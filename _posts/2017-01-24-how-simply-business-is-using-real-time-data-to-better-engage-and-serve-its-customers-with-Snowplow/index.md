## Challenges
Simply Business engages with its customers through a variety of channels and it was essential for them to build a single customer view, which was not possible prior to using Snowplow.
Another important requirement was to process the data in real time to enhance the user experience on the website and better equip call center staff to assist customers.

## Simply Business + Snowplow = state-of-the-art data capability

With Snowplow, Simply Business has been able to set up a state of the art data and analytics capability. This has enabled Simply Business to further develop its reputation as a data innovator and attain the following accomplishments using Snowplow data:

* Measure more accurately the influence each channel has on the conversion funnel and the Return On Advertising Spending.
* Build a multi-channel attribution model to optimize the allocation of spend across their different marketing channels.
* Empower the product team to easily identify and resolve on-site issues.
