We are pleased to announce version [0.2.0] [020-release] of [SQL Runner] [repo]. SQL Runner is an open source app, written in Go, that makes it easy to execute SQL statements programmatically as part of the Snowplow data pipeline.

To use SQL Runner, you assemble a playbook i.e. a YAML file that lists the different `.sql` files to be run and the database they are to be run against. It is possible to specify which sequence the files should be run, and to run files in parallel.

<h2 id="new-features">1. New features</h2>

The main addition is the ability to run SQL against Redshift and Postgres databases which have SSL security enabled. Many thanks to Dennis Waldron from Space Ape Games for contributing this feature!

Update the database targets in your playbooks to use the new `ssl` parameter:

{% highlight yaml %}
targets:
  - name: "My Postgres database 1"
    type: postgres
    host: localhost
    database: sql_runner_tests_1
    port: 5432
    username: postgres
    password:
    ssl: false # SSL disabled by default, or set to true
{% endhighlight %}

Other updates in this version:

* Fixed typo of "queries executed againt targets" ([#20] [issue-20])
* Updated vagrant up to work with latest Peru version ([#25] [issue-25])
* Replaced bitbucket.org/kardianos/osext with github.com/kardianos/osext ([#33] [issue-33])
