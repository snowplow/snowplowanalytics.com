<h2><a name="events">1. New events</a></h2>

<h3><a name="forms">1.1 Automatic form tracking</a></h3>

Enable automatic form tracking using the `enableFormTracking` method:

{% highlight javascript %}
snowplow('enableFormTracking');
{% endhighlight %}

Whenever a user changes the value of a field in a form, the Tracker will fire a [`change_form`][change_form] unstructured event capturing the name, type, and CSS classes of the changed element, the ID of the parent form, and the new value of the field.

Whenever a user submits a form, the Tracker will fire a [`submit_form`][submit_form] event. This event captures the ID of the parent form and the names, types, and final values of all `input`, `select`, and `textarea` elements in the form.

When you call the method, it will only attach event listeners to existing forms, so you should call it again whenever you create a new form element. (This is safe - the Tracker will not attach more than one event listener to an element.)

<h3><a name="cart">1.2 add_to_cart and remove_from_cart</a></h3>

Use the new `trackAddToCart` and `trackRemoveFromCart` methods to track [`add_to_cart`][add_to_cart] and [`remove_from_cart`][remove_from_cart] events. The signatures of the methods are identical:

{% highlight javascript %}
trackRemoveFromCart(sku, name, category, unitPrice, quantity, currency, context);
{% endhighlight %}

Use them like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
snowplow('trackAddToCart', 'item-000303', 'small waistcoat', 'clothing', 79.99, 2, 'USD');
{% endhighlight %}

<h3><a name="social">1.3 social_interaction</a></h3>

The `trackSocialInteraction` method lets you track [`social_interaction`][social_interaction] events on you site. This is its signature:

{% highlight javascript %}
trackSocialInteraction(action, network, target, context);
{% endhighlight %}

An example:

{% highlight javascript %}
snowplow('trackSocialInteraction', 'like', 'Facebook', 'blog post 0012');
{% endhighlight %}

<h3><a name="search">1.4 site_search</a></h3>

The new `site_search` event describes a user performing a search on a website. It can capture the search terms and search filters used, the number of results found, and the number of results displayed on the first page.

This is the signature of the corresponding method:

{% highlight javascript %}
trackSiteSearch(terms, filters, totalResults, pageResults, context);
{% endhighlight %}

And an example of `trackSiteSearch` in action:

{% highlight javascript %}
snowplow('trackSiteSearch', ['event', 'streams'], {
  'category': 'books',
  'safeSearch': true
}, 10, 8);
{% endhighlight %}

The `filters` parameter is a dictionary whose values can be strings or booleans.

<h2><a name="performance">2. Page performance context</a></h2>

The `trackPageView` method now accepts an additional boolean parameter named "performanceTracking":

{% highlight javascript %}
trackPageView(customTitle, performanceTracking, context);
{% endhighlight %}

If you set this parameter to `true`, a [`PerformanceTiming`][performancetiming] context will be added to the page view event. This context will contain all the data found in the [`window.performance.timing`][navigationtiming] variable, and so can be used to calculate how long the page took to load.

<h2><a name="content">3. Link content</a></h2>

The `link_click` event has been updated to include an optional `content` field. This will be populated with the `innerHTML` property of the link. The `enableLinkClickTracking` now has a "trackContent" parameter which you must set to `true` to capture the innerHTML of clicked links:

{% highlight javascript %}
enableLinkClickTracking(criterion, pseudoClicks, trackContent, context);
{% endhighlight %}

The `trackLinkClick` method, which is used to track individual clicks manually, now accepts an additional string parameter named "content":

{% highlight javascript %}
trackLinkClick(targetUrl, elementId, elementClasses, elementTarget, elementContent, context);
{% endhighlight %}

<h2><a name="core">4. Tracker core integration</a></h2>

The [Snowplow JavaScript Tracker Core][tracker-core] was designed to contain the functionality common to both the client-side JavaScript Tracker and the [Node.js Tracker][nodejs-tracker].

This release integrates the core into the client-side Tracker. As a consequence, the random 6-digit "transaction ID" attached to all events has been replaced by a unique type 4 UUID, which will serve as the `event_id` for this event. This makes the false positive rate for detecting duplicate events negligible.

<h2><a name="callbacks">5. Custom callbacks </a></h2>

You can now specify callback functions which will only be called when `sp.js` has been loaded and initialized:

{% highlight javascript %}
function snowplowCallback() {
	console.log("Snowplow has loaded");
}

snowplow(snowplowCallback);
{% endhighlight %}

<h2><a name="https">6. forceSecureTracker</a></h2>

By default, events are sent to a collector using the same protocol ("http" or "https") as the current page. Huge thanks to community member @kujo4pmZ for contributing the option to force the tracker to send all events over https! Just add a `forceSecureTracker` field when creating a tracker:

{% highlight javascript %}
        window.snowplow('newTracker', 'cf', 'd3rkrsqld9gmqf.cloudfront.net', { // Initialise a tracker
          appId: 'CFe23a',
          platform: 'mob',
          forceSecureTracker: true // Requests will be made over https
        });
{% endhighlight %}

<h2><a name="outbound">7. Outbound queue</a></h2>

Previous versions of the tracker had a `pageUnloadTimer` which you could use to set a pause between an event being created and the page unloading, to give the tracker time to fire the event. Version 2.1.1 makes the timeout more intelligent: once all queued events have been sent, the page will unload, even if the `pageUnloadTimer` has not yet expired.

<h2><a name="example">8. New example page</a></h2>

The new [async-large.html][async-large] file shows how the Snowplow JavaScript Tracker works even if two people are independently loading and using it on the same page. It also provides examples of all the new unstructured events.

<h2><a name="other">9. Other improvements</a></h2>

We have also:

* Moved the context field to the end of the querystring in case it gets truncated [#204][204]
* Improved the efficiency of link click tracking [#254][254]
* Extracted link tracking functionality into its own file [#266][266]
* Made the regular expression used to match IP addresses more strict [#267][267]
* Renamed the "dist" directory to "deploy" [#216][216]
* Improved the CodeClimate rating for the project [#150][150]
* Added further Intern unit tests [#76][76]
* Added a section to the README for contributors on getting the Vagrant environment set up [#169][169]

Finally, we thank Kevin Simper (@kevinsimper on GitHub) for his contribution preventing the `localStorage` queue of events from being incorrectly parsed.

<h2><a name="upgrading">10. Upgrading</a></h2>

<h3><a name="upgrade-js">10.1 JavaScript upgrade</a></h3>

The new minified and gzipped JavaScript is available at

`http(s)://d1fc8wv8zag5ca.cloudfront.net/2.1.1/sp.js``

**Note that this version introduces BREAKING changes to the `trackPageView`, `enableLinkClickTracking`, and `trackLinkClick` methods, all of which now have an additional penultimate parameter.**

The deprecated legacy method `trackImpression` has been removed entirely; use `trackAdImpression` instead.

<h3><a name="upgrade-redshift">10.2 Redshift upgrade</a></h3>

If you are using Amazon Redshift, the new event types and performance context will require you to deploy new tables into your Redshift cluster.

For instructions on this, please see today's [Snowplow 0.9.10 release] [0.9.10-release] blog post.
