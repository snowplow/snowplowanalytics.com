<h2 id="gzip-support">1. gzip support</h2>

Kinesis S3 now supports [gzip][gzip] as a second storage/compression option for the files it writes out to S3. Using this format, each record is treated as a byte array containing a UTF-8 encoded string (whether CSV, JSON or TSV). The records are then written to files as strings, one record per line and gzipped.

Big thanks go to [Kacper Bielecki][kazjote] for contributing this storage option! For more information please see [Kacper's pull request][pr-43].

Snowplow users please note: you must continue to use the LZO format for storing raw Snowplow events.

<h2 id="loops">2. Infinite loops</h2>

With the recent [Amazon S3 outage] [hn-s3-outage] in us-east-1, an issue was discovered where Kinesis S3 was unable to recover the connection to S3 even after the service was restored. This resulted in an infinite loop of failures to `PUT` any records into S3. To fix this, we had to manually restart all Kinesis S3 instances.

To prevent this recurring, Kinesis S3 now supports a failure timeout: if failures extend beyond this timeout, then Kinesis S3 will **self-terminate**. You can specify this timeout in the configuration file:

{% highlight json %}
// Failure allowed for one minute
sink.s3.max-timeout: 60000
{% endhighlight %}

This feature can be neatly coupled with an automated restart wrapper to ensure that the application will recover without human intervention.

<h2 id="control">3. Safer record batching</h2>

In the [previous release post][previous-rel] we discussed potential out-of-memory problems for this application. To improve things further we have implemented a new configuration option: `max-records` to specify how many records the application is allowed to read per `GetRecords` call. This helps prevent the application from suddenly exceeding the Heap with sudden traffic spikes.

{% highlight json %}
// Amount of records per GetRecords call
sink.kinesis.in.max-records: 10000
{% endhighlight %}

Unless you are experiencing out-of-memory issues, we recommend using the default of `10000`. Please note that `10000`, for the moment, is also the maximum setting.  If set any higher an `InvalidArgumentException` [will be thrown][aws-exception].

<h2 id="bug-fixes">4. Bug fixes</h2>

We have also:

* Fixed a bug where the Snowplow Tracker was using the wrong event type for `write_failures` ([#45][45])
* Added logging for `OutOfMemoryErrors` so it is easier to debug in the future ([#29][29])

<h2 id="upgrading">5. Upgrading</h2>

The Kinesis S3 application is available in a single zip file here:

    http://bintray.com/artifact/download/snowplow/snowplow-generic/kinesis_s3_0.4.0.zip

Upgrading will require various configuration changes to the application's HOCON configuration file:

* Add `max-records` to the `sink.kinesis.in` section and configure how many records you want the application to get at any one time
* Add `format` to the `sink.s3` section and select either `lzo` or `gzip` to control what format files are written in
* Add `max-timeout` to the `sink.s3` section and enter the maximum timeout in ms for the application

And that's it - you should now be fully upgraded!

<h2 id="help">6. Getting help</h2>
