As of this weekend, the Snowplow repository on GitHub now has over 200 stars! We're hugely excited to reach this milestone - this makes us:

* The 3rd most-watched analytics project on GitHub, after [Hummingbird] [hummingbird] (real-time analytics) and [Countly] [countly] (mobile analytics)
* The [58th most-watched] [scala-project-58] Scala project on GitHub

Many thanks to everyone in the Snowplow community and on GitHub for their support and interest!

We thought it might be interesting to share the [Red Dwarf heatmap] [red-dwarf] of where our 202 GitHub stars are located across the world:

Beyond the "hot spots" in the US and Europe, it's encouraging to see growing interest in Snowplow from South America, South/East Asia and Australia/New Zealand. We look forward to checking back on the heatmap when we have some more stars!
