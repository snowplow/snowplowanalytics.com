Final details are still being confirmed. However, we can already announce two awesome speakers: [Simon Rumble] [rumble], Head of Data, Analytics and CRM at [Bauer Media Australia] [bauer], and [Narbeh Yousefian][narbeh], cofounder at [Digdeep digital] [digdeep], will both be giving talks. Both are incredibly knowledge about Snowplow and the digital analytics space in general.

The event will be hosted by our very own [Josh Beemster] [josh], who is returning to Sydney having left for the quiet of Dijon, France. It is being hosted by Narbeh and the Digdeep Digital team at their office at level 4, 80 Clarence Street, Sydney 2000.

## Breaking news (December 7): first talk title and description announced

In Simon's own words. I cannot wait...

<h3>Snowplow is at the core of everything we do <small>Simon Rumble, Bauer Media</small></h3>

At Bauer Media we started out using Snowplow just because we're data completists and having it all in one place felt right. It now forms the core for a bunch of services that are driving future growth. In this session I'll demo our recommendations, trending and dashboard services and give a bit of insight into how we've rolled behavioural data from 116 sites into one place.
