I was very fortunate to be invited to speak at the [Data Insights Cambridge] [meetup] last week, where I gave a talk describing our evolving thinking about event data at Snowplow.

The slides I presented are below.

The Data Insights meetup group is fantastic group with members working with data in a diverse set of industries and roles. It made for some very interesting questions and discussions after.

Big thanks to Sobia for organising the event and inviting us to attend, and our good friends at [Metail] [metail] for hosting the event in their lovely offices. I hope to get the chance to return soon!
