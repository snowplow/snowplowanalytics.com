We are proud to be releasing [version 0.5.0][release-050] of Kinesis S3, our project dedicated to
sinking [Kinesis streams][kinesis], including Snowplow raw and enriched event streams, to S3. This
release revolves around community-driven improvements as well as the modernization of the project.

<h2 id="fix">1. Fix silent suppression of failures</h2>

We've uncovered a situation where failures prior to the serialization of the records stored in
Kinesis were silently dismissed. This release introduces a fix for this, so we strongly recommend
everyone using Kinesis S3 to upgrade to 0.5.0.

The details of the issue and fix can be found in [issue 101][i101].

<h2 id="contribs">2. Community contributions</h2>

This release has been largely driven by some fantastic community contributions, which we will detail here.

<h3 id="gzipped">2.1 Newline at the end of gzipped files</h3>

[Kacper Bielecki][kazjote] from [LiveIntent][liveintent] discovered that the last record of gzipped
files was dismissed as a result of a missing empty newline and contributed a fix. Thanks a lot Kacper!

<h3 id="china">2.2 Support for Kinesis in the China region</h3>

The Kinesis endpoint in China (`kinesis.cn-north-1.amazonaws.com.cn`) doesn't conform to the usual
endpoint format (`kinesis.{{region}}.amazonaws.com`). As a result, it was not supported by Kinesis S3.

This has now been fixed by [Bob Xiao][bobshaw1912] - thanks Bob!

<h3 id="env">2.3 Resolving environment variables in the configuration</h3>

From now on, you will be able to include environment variables in your configuration file, like so:

{% highlight json %}
sink {
  aws {
    access-key: "${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}"
    secret-key: "${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}"
  }
  // ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

This feature was contributed by [Shin Nien][shin-nien], thanks a lot!

<h2 id="updates">3. Updates</h2>

We also took advantage of this release to do a full refresh on Kinesis S3, which translates into:

- Moving to Scala 2.11 ([#81][i81])
- Moving to Java 8 ([#82][i82])
- Updating the Kinesis Client library ([#55][i55])
- A flurry of [other library updates](https://github.com/snowplow/kinesis-s3/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue%20milestone%3A"Version%200.5.0"%20"Bump"%20)

<h2 id="roadmap">4. Roadmap</h2>

Going forwards, we're interested in exploring support for additional formats, such as [Apache Parquet][parquet] or
[Apache Avro][avro].

Additionally, we want to extend the existing support for LZO, providing a way to store LZO files
without their indices.

Finally, we'd like to reduce Kinesis S3's coupling with Kinesis by supporting [NSQ][nsq]. This is part of an ongoing effort to have the Snowplow platform become cloud-agnostic. At that point we will rename this project to the Snowplow S3 Loader.

<h2 id="contributing">5. Contributing</h2>

You can check out the [repository][repo] if you'd like to get involved! In particular, if there is
an issue in the [0.6.0 milestone](https://github.com/snowplow/kinesis-s3/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A"Version+0.6.0")
that catches your eye, don't hesitate to add a comment saying that you've started working on it.
