The third Snowplow Meetup London take place last Wednesday evening. The event was focused on real-time event data processing. It's been more than two and a half years since we started working on the Snowplow real-time pipeline and it is great that in the last few months usage of that technology has really started to sky rocket!

[Simply Business's][simply-business] [Dani Sola][dani-sola] kicked the event off with a look at how Simply Business use their real-time event stream to personalise the web user experience for users visiting from a radio campaigns, and to provide comprehensive near-real time reporting about the performance of their call center teams. (Simply Business do a great job of tracking their users across both web and call center seamlesslly with Snowplow.) Dani went into a fair amount of technical detail including a detailed description of why and how they use Spark Streaming to process their event data, and how the real-time visitor data is made easily available to user-facing applciations via a visitor API.

Our very own [Alex][alex-dean] followed up with a talk on Tupilak: our fabric for monitoring, autoscaling and alerting real-time pipelines. At Snowplow we run many real-time pipelines on behalf of our clients and Tupilak is a platform we've developed to enable us to do this effectively at scale. Tupilak enables us to visualize, reason about and manage complicated real-time data processing topologies. We rely on it to alert us to pipeline issues (e.g. processing lag) and automatically scale pipelines to efficiently handle traffic spikes.
