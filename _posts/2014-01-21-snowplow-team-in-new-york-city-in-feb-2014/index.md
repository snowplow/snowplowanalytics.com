Both Yali and myself will be visiting New York this February, and I will be heading on to Boston too. If you're interested in meeting up to discuss Snowplow, event analytics or big data processing more generally, we'd love to arrange a meeting.

Yali will be in NYC between February 9th and 12th, including attending the [Looker user group NYC meetup] [look-and-tell-meetup] on February 11th.

Alex will be visiting later on in the month:

* New York City, February 20th - 25th
* Boston, February 26th - 27th

Reach out to us at yali@ or alex@ (email addresses on our full domain) to setup a meet, suggest an event we should attend or for anything else East Coast-related!
