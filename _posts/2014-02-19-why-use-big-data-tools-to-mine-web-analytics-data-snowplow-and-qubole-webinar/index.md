Last night, I presented at a webinar organized by our friends at [Qubole] [qubole] on using big data tools to analyze web analytics data. You can view the slides I presented below:

On the webinar, I talked through the limitations associated with using traditional web analytics tools like Google Analytics and Adobe SiteCatalyst to do web analytics data, and how using big data technologies, and Snowplow and Qubole in particular, addressed those limitations. My talk was followed by one from Qubole's own Rajat Jain on the Qubole Data Service proposition.

The Qubole guys have promised to publish the full list of slides (both mine and Rajat's) and a video recording of the event on their website. When they do, I'll post a link to it here.
