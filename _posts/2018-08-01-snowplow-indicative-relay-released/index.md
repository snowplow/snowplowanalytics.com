We are pleased to announce the release of the Snowplow Indicative Relay.

This is a Snowplow relay project, implemented as an [AWS Lambda][aws-lambda] function which allows for sending batches
of Snowplow enriched events from a Kinesis stream into [Indicative][indicative].

<h2 id="indicative">1. What is Indicative?</h2>

[Indicative][indicative] is an emerging customer analytics platform, optimised for customer journey analytics.

It is particularly well suited for marketers, product managers, and analysts. Indicative connects to many data sources in order to give a needed insight into users behavior - and is a great fit for analyzing Snowplow event data.

To learn more about using Indicative with Snowplow, take a look at our [previous blog post][snowplow-indicative-blog].

<h2 id="how-does-it-work">2. How does the relay work?</h2>

Snowplow Relay is an initiative for feeding Snowplow enriched events into third-party tools or *destinations*, from SaaS marketing platforms to open-source machine learning engines to fraud detection services. We call an individual app that feeds Snowplow events into a specific destination a *relay*.

The Snowplow Indicative Relay is a Kinesis stream consumer in a form of an AWS Lambda function.

The relay retrieves events from a Kinesis stream of Snowplow enriched events, transforms them to be compatible with Indicative's event model, and then loads them into Indicative in real time using the [Indicative REST API][indicative-rest-api].

<h2 id="setup">3. Requirements and setup</h2>

To simplify the process of deploying the Snowplow Indicative Relay function, Snowplow Analytics provides its jar file through [Hosted assets][hosted-assets] on AWS S3.

Detailed setup instructions, as well as more technical information, are provided on the project's [GitHub wiki page][github-wiki-page].

<h2 id="usage">4. Usage</h2>

Once setup, the data should flow into Indicative in near real time. All event types can 
be viewed under *Events and Properties* in the Indicative's settings. You can also assign
more descriptive labels and categories for the incoming properties.

Indicative lets you observe and analyze user journeys through *Funnels*,
which represent multidimensional user conversions.

*Segmentation* tool allows creation of classic key performance indicators
and use them to analyze user trends.
