Franz Posch, co-founder at Incuda, explained how they use Snowplow data to build an integrated, journey-based view of user interactions to drive customer and product analytics.

<h2 id="sauna">Turning insights into action with Sauna</h2>

Alex Dean, our co-founder, talked about Sauna, our exciting new open-source product designed to make it easy for business analysts to turn insights they derive from their event streams into actions. If Snowplow makes it easier for data analysts to build intelligence on their data, Sauna makes it easy for them to action that intelligence, by feeding it back into the different channels that are used to manage customer engagement.
