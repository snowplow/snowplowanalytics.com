Last month [Josh] [josh] returned to Sydney, where he organised the second [Snowplow Analytics Meetup Sydney] [meetup] event.

Simon Rumble kicked off the event with a detailed presentation (and demo): [Snowplow drives everything we do] [simon-pres]. You can view Simon's presentation below, or the original Google Doc [here] [simon-pres]. Simon described the Snowplow journey that Bauer Australia had gone on, from using it as an experimental tool to using it at the heart of their dashboarding, analytics, trending and recommendation services.
