Snowplow clients who have been working with us on analytics projects, and anyone who's been keeping up with our releases, will have noticed a new face on the Snowplow team. It is with great pleasure that we introduce Christophe Bogaert to the Snowplow communitiy.

Christophe joined us as our first Data Scientist in Februray. He designed, tested and delivered the data models that are at the heart of last week's [Snowplow v.64 Palila release][r64] - an impressive feat in his first two months with us. In parallel he has worked with a number of our users to develop bespoke data models, reports and dashboards. He is currently evaluating and developing attribution modeling on Snowplow data, and porting our data modeling to Spark: stay tuned to our [Analytics Cookbook][cookbook] and [blog][blog] for updates!

Welcome to the team Christophe!
