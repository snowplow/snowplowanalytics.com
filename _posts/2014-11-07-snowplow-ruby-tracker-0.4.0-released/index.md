We are pleased to announce the release of version 0.4.0 of the Snowplow Ruby Tracker. This release adds several methods to help identify users using client-side data, making the Ruby Tracker much more powerful when used from a Ruby web or e-commerce framework such as [Rails] [rails], [Sinatra] [sinatra] or [Spree] [spree].

The rest of this post will cover:

1. [set_ip_address](#ip)
2. [set_useragent_user_id](#ua)
3. [set_domain_user_id](#nuid)
4. [set_network_user_id](#duid)
5. [Other changes](#other)
6. [Getting help](#help)

<h2><a name="ip">1. set_ip_address</a></h2>

The `ip_address` field in the Snowplow event model is used to look up information about a user's geographical location (among other things - see our [scala-maxmind-iplookups][iplookups] project for more detail). If you have access to a user's IP address, you can add it to all events concerning that user with the `set_ip_address` method:

```ruby
subject.set_ip_address("37.157.33.93")
```

<h2><a name="ua">2. set_useragent</a></h2>

The `useragent` field contains information (sometimes called the "browser string") about the user's browser. You can set this field with the `set_useragent` method:

```ruby
subject.set_useragent("Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:23.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/23.0")
```

<h2><a name="duid">3. set_domain_user_id</a></h2>

The `domain_userid` field in the Snowplow event model refers to the user ID set by the [Snowplow JavaScript Tracker][js-tracker] and stored in the [ID cookie][id-cookie]. If you extract that ID, you can use the `set_domain_user_id` method to associate a subject with it:

```ruby
subject.set_domain_user_id("c7aadf5c60a5dff9")
```

This is useful if you are tracking events both server-side and client-side and want to know when they concern the same user.

<h2><a name="nuid">4. set_network_user_id</a></h2>

The `network_userid` field is a user ID set by Snowplow's [Clojure Collector][clojure-collector] and [Scala Stream Collector][ssc] via a third party cookie. Similarly to the `set_domain_user_id` method, the `set_network_user_id` lets you associate a subject with a network user ID:

```ruby
subject.set_network_user_id("ecdff4d0-9175-40ac-a8bb-325c49733607")
```

**Please note that making use of this functionality in Snowplow is dependent on [issue #1095] [issue-1095] in the core Snowplow project, which has not yet been released.**

<h2><a name="other">5. Other changes</a></h2>

Two other changes have been made to the Ruby Tracker "under the hood":

1. We are now correctly using SSL for requests over HTTPS ([#52] [issue-52])
2. We are now sending version 1-0-1 of the `payload_data` schema, to correspond to the four new fields ([#45] [issue-45])

<h2><a name="help">6. Getting help</a></h2>
