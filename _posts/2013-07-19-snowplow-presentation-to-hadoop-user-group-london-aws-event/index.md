Yesterday at the [Hadoop User Group][hug-uk], I was very fortunate to get the opportunity to speak about Snowplow at the event focused specifically on Amazon Web Services, and Redshift in particular.

I hope the talk was interesting to the participants who attended. I described how we use Cloudfront and Elastic Beanstalk to get event data into AWS for processing by EMR, and how we push the output of our EMR-based enrichment process into Redshift for analysis. The slides I presented are below:
