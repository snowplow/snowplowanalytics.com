We are proud to be releasing [version 0.5.0][release-050] of Kinesis S3, our project dedicated to
sinking [Kinesis streams][kinesis] to S3. This release revolves around community-driven improvements
as well as the modernization of the project.

This post will cover:

1. [Community contributions](/blog/2017/06/30/kinesis-s3-0.5.0-released#contribs)
2. [Updates](/blog/2017/06/30/kinesis-s3-0.5.0-released#updates)
3. [Roadmap](/blog/2017/06/30/kinesis-s3-0.5.0-released#roadmap)

<h2 id="contribs">1. Community contributions</h2>

This release has been driven by community contributions which we will detail here.

<h3 id="gzipped">1.1 Newline at the end of gzipped files</h3>

[Kacper Bielecki][kazjote] from [LiveIntent][liveintent] discovered that the last record of gzipped
files was dismissed as a result of a missing empty newline and contributed a fix. Thanks a lot to
him!

<h3 id="china">1.2 Support for the Chinese Kinesis endpoint</h3>

The Chinese Kinesis endpoint (kinesis.cn-north-1.amazonaws.com.cn) doesn't conform to the usual
endpoint format (kinesis.{{region}}.amazonaws.com). As a result, it was not supported out of the
box by kinesis-s3. However, thanks to [Bob Xiao][bobshaw1912], the Chinese region will be supported
going forward.

<h3 id="env">1.3 Resolving environment variables in the configuration</h3>

From now on, you will be able to include environment variables in your configuration file:

{% highlight json %}
sink {
  aws {
    access-key: "${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}"
    secret-key: "${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}"
  }
  // ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

This feature was contributed by [shin-nien][shin-nien], thanks a lot!

<h2 id="updates">2. Updates</h2>

We also took advantage of this release to keep kinesis-s3 up to date, this translates into:

- moving to Scala 2.11 ([#81][i81])
- moving to Java 8 ([#82][i82])
- updating the Kinesis Client library ([#55][i55])
- a flurry of [other library updates](https://github.com/snowplow/kinesis-s3/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20milestone%3A"Version%200.5.0"%20"Bump"%20)

<h2 id="roadmap">3. Roadmap</h2>

For the next release, we're planning on supporting new formats such as [Apache Parquet][parquet] or
[Apache Avro][avro].

Additionally, we want to extend the existing support for LZO and provide a way to store LZO files
without their indices.

Finally, we'd like to reduce kinesis-s3's coupling with Kinesis by supporting [NSQ][nsq]. This
is part of an ongoing effort to have the Snowplow platform become cloud-agnostic.

that catches your eye, don't hesitate to add a
