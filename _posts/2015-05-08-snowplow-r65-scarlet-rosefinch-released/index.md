<h2><a name="enhancedPerformance">1. Enhanced performance</a></h2>

Kinesis' new [PutRecords API][putrecords] enabled the biggest performance improvement: rather than sending events to Kinesis one at a time, we can now send batches of up to 500. This greatly increases the event volumes which the Scala Stream Collector and Scala Kinesis Enrich can handle.

You might not want to always wait for a full 500 events before sending the stored records to Kinesis, so the configuration for both applications now has a `buffer` section which provides greater control over when the stored records get sent.

It has three fields:

1. `byte-limit`: if the stored records total at least this many bytes, flush the buffer
2. `record-limit`: if at least this many records are in the buffer, flush the buffer
3. `time-limit`: if at least this many milliseconds have passed since the buffer was last flushed, flush the buffer

An example with sensible defaults:

{% highlight bash %}
buffer: {
    byte-limit: 4500000 # 4.5MB
    record-limit: 500 # 500 records
    time-limit: 60000 # 1 minute
}
{% endhighlight %}

Additionally, the Scala Stream Collector has a `ShutdownHook` which sends all stored records. This prevents stored events from being lost when the collector is shut down cleanly.

<h2><a name="cors">2. CORS support</a></h2>

The Scala Stream Collector now supports [CORS][cors] requests, so you can send events to it from Snowplow's client-side [JavaScript Tracker][js-tracker] using POST rather than GET. This means that your requests are no longer subject to Internet Explorer's querystring size limit.

The Scala Stream Collector also now supports cross-origin requests from the [Snowplow ActionScript 3.0 Tracker][as-tracker].

<h2><a name="reliability">3. Increased reliability</a></h2>

If an attempt to write records to Kinesis failed, previous versions of the Kinesis apps would just log an error message. The new release prevents events from being lost in the event that Kinesis is temporarily unreachable by implementing an [exponential backoff strategy with jitter][backoff] when PutRecords requests fail.

The minimum and maximum backoffs to use are configurable in the `backoffPolicy` for the Scala Stream Collector and Scala Kinesis Enrich:

{% highlight bash %}
backoffPolicy: {
    minBackoff: 3000 # 3 seconds
    maxBackoff: 600000 # 5 minutes
}
{% endhighlight %}

<h2><a name="dynamodb">4. Loading configuration from DynamoDB</a></h2>

The command-line arguments to Scala Kinesis Enrich have also changed. It used to be the case that you provided a `--config` argument, pointing to a [HOCON][hocon] file with configuration for the app, together with an optional `--enrichments` argument, pointing to a directory containing the JSON configurations for the enrichments you wanted to make use of:

{% highlight bash %}
./scala-kinesis-enrich-0.4.0 --config my.conf --enrichments path/to/enrichments
{% endhighlight %}

Scarlet Rosefinch makes three changes:

* The "resolver" section of the configuration HOCON has been split into a separate JSON file which should be specified using the command line argument `--resolver`.
* If you want to get the resolver JSON and the enrichment JSONs from the local filesystem, you need to preface their filepaths with "file:".
* You can now also load the resolver JSON and enrichment JSONs from DynamoDB

To recreate the pre-r65 behavior, convert the `resolver` section of your configuration HOCON to JSON and put it in its own file, "iglu_resolver.json". Then start the enricher like this:

{% highlight bash %}
./scala-kinesis-enrich-0.4.0 --config my.conf --resolver file:iglu_resolver.json --enrichments file:path/to/enrichments
{% endhighlight %}

To get the resolver from DynamoDB, create a table named "snowplow_config" with hashkey "id" and add an item to the table of the following form:

{% highlight json %}
{
    "id": "iglu_resolver",
    "json": "{The resolver as a JSON string}"
}
{% endhighlight %}

Then provide the `resolver` argument as follows:

{% highlight bash %}
--resolver dynamodb:us-east-1/snowplow_config/iglu_resolver
{% endhighlight %}

To get the enrichments from DynamoDB, the enrichment JSONs must all be stored in a table - you can reuse the "snowplow_config" table. The enrichments' hash keys should have a common prefix, for example "enrich_":

{% highlight json %}
{
    "id": "enrich_anon_ip",
    "json": "{anon_ip enrichment configuration as a JSON string}"
}

{
    "id": "enrich_ip_lookups",
    "json": "{ip_lookups enrichment configuration as a JSON string}"
}
{% endhighlight %}

Then provide the `resolver` argument as follows:

{% highlight bash %}
--enrichments dynamodb:us-east-1/snowplow_config/enrich_
{% endhighlight %}

If you are using a different AWS region, replace "us-east-1" accordingly.

The full command:

{% highlight bash %}
./scala-kinesis-enrich-0.5.0 --config my.conf \
  --resolver dynamodb:us-east-1/snowplow_config/iglu_resolver \
  --enrichments dynamodb:us-east-1/snowplow_config/enrich_
{% endhighlight %}

<h2><a name="randomization">5. Randomized partition keys for bad streams</a></h2>

When sending a record to Kinesis, you provide a [partition key][partition-key]. The hash of this key determines which shard will process the record. The good events generated by Scala Kinesis Enrich use the `user_ipaddress` field of the event as the key, so that events from a single user will all be in the right order in the same shard.

Previously, the bad events generated by Scala Kinesis Enrich and the Kinesis Elasticsearch Sink all had the same partition key. This meant that no matter how many shards the stream for bad records contained, all bad records would be processed by the same shard. Scarlet Rosefinch fixes this by using random partition keys for bad events.

<h2><a name="automaticStreams">6. Removal of automatic stream creation</a></h2>

The Kinesis apps will no longer automatically create a stream if they detect that the configured stream does not exist.

This means that if you make a typo when configuring the stream name, the mistake will immediately cause an error rather than creating an incorrectly named new stream which no other app knows about.

<h2><a name="tokenization">7. Improved Elasticsearch index initialization</a></h2>

We now recommend that when setting up your Elasticsearch index, you turn off [tokenization][tokenization] of string fields. You can do this by choosing "keyword" as the default analyzer:

{% highlight bash %}
curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/snowplow' -d '{
    "settings": {
        "analysis": {
            "analyzer": {
                "default": {
                    "type": "keyword"
                }
            }
        }
    },
    "mappings": {
        "enriched": {
            "_timestamp" : {
                "enabled" : "yes",
                "path" : "collector_tstamp"
            },
            "_ttl": {
              "enabled":true,
              "default": "604800000"
            },
            "properties": {
                "geo_location": {
                    "type": "geo_point"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}'
{% endhighlight %}

This has two positive effects:

* URLs are no longer incorrectly tokenized
* Not having to tokenize every string field improves the performance of the Elasticsearch cluster

<h2><a name="otherChanges">8. Other changes</a></h2>

We have also:

* Started logging the names of the streams to which the Scala Stream Collector and Scala Kinesis Enrich write events ([#1503][1503], [#1493][1493])
* Added macros to the "config.hocon.sample" sample configuration files ([#1471][1471], [#1472][1472], [#1513][1513], [#1515][1515])
* Fixed a bug which caused the Kinesis Elasticsearch Sink to silently drop inputs containing fewer than 24 tab-separated fields ([#1584][1584])
* Fixed a bug which prevented the applications from using a DynamoDB table in the configured region ([#1576][1576], [#1582][1582], [#1583][1583])
* Added the ability to prevent the Scala Stream Collector from setting 3rd-party cookies by setting the cookie expiration field to 0 ([#1363][1363])
* Bumped the version of Scala Common Enrich used by Scala Kinesis Enrich to 0.13.1 ([#1618][1618])
* Bumped the version of [Scalazon][scalazon] we use to 0.11 to access PutRecords ([#1492][1492], [#1504][1504])
* Stopped Scala Kinesis Enrich outputting records of over 50kB because they are exceed Kinesis' size limit ([#1649][1649])

<h2><a name="upgrading">9. Upgrading</a></h2>

The Kinesis apps for r65 Scarlet Rosefinch are now all available in a single zip file here:

    http://dl.bintray.com/snowplow/snowplow-generic/snowplow_kinesis_r65_scarlet_rosefinch.zip

Upgrading will require various configuration changes to each of the four applications:

<h3>Scala Stream Collector</h3>

* Add `backoffPolicy` and `buffer` fields to the configuration HOCON.

<h3>Scala Kinesis Enrich</h3>

* Add `backoffPolicy` and `buffer` fields to the configuration HOCON
* Extract the resolver from the configuration HOCON into its own JSON file, which can be stored locally or in DynamoDB
* Update the command line arguments as detailed [above](#dynamodb)

<h3>Kinesis LZO S3 Sink</h3>

* Rename the outermost key in the configuration HOCON from "connector" to "sink"
* Replace the "s3/endpoint" field with an "s3/region" field (such as "us-east-1")

<h3>Kinesis Elasticsearch Sink</h3>

* Rename the outermost key in the configuration HOCON from "connector" to "sink"

And that's it - you should now be fully upgraded!
