#### [Budapest Datawarehousing Forum] [budapest-dw-forum]

Alex will be giving a talk at the Budapest DW Forum on Thursday 5th June on our experiences building real time data processing infrastructure on Amazon Kinesis. His talk will cover:

* "Hero" use cases for event streaming
* Buildin a lambda architecture with Kinesis and EMR
* Moving form a batch to a streaming mindset

For more information, check out the [Talks page](http://2014.budapestdwforum.com/talks/#alexdean) on the Budapest DW Forum 2014 website.

The following day, he will be giving a half day, *From zero to Hadoop*, walking through how to run a range of simple (but powerful) Hadoop jobs on Elastic Mapreduce, including both Pig scripts, Scalding Jobs and using HBase with Hadoop.

Alex will be in Budapest from June 3rd to 6th. If you'd like to grab Alex when he's in Budapest, reach out to him on alex at snowplowanalytics dot com.


#### [Digital Analytics Hub] [da-hub-berlin] event in Berlin

I'm really looking forward to attending the Digital Analytics Hub event in Berlin, an event I've heard many good things about, but haven't had the chance to attend before.

I'll be in Berlin between June 2nd and 4th. If you'd like to meet, then ping me on yali at snowplowanalytics dot com. In the meantime, keep plowing!
