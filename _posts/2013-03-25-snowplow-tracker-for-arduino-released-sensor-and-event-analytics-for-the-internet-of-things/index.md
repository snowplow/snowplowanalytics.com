Today we are releasing our first non-Web tracker for Snowplow - an event tracker for the [Arduino] [arduino] open-source electronics prototyping platform. The [Snowplow Arduino Tracker] [snowplow-arduino-tracker] lets you track sensor and event-stream information from one or more IP-connected Arduino boards.

We chose this as our first non-Web tracker because we're hugely excited about the potential of sophisticated analytics for the [Internet of Things] [iot], following in the footsteps of great projects like [Cosm] [cosm] and [Exosite] [exosite]. And of course, Snowplow's extremely-scalable architecture is a great fit for the huge volumes of events and sensor readings which machines are able to generate - you could say that we are already "machine-scale"!

As far as we know, this is the first time an event analytics platform has released a dedicated tracker for the maker community; we can't wait to see what the Arduino and Snowplow communities will use it for! Some ideas we had were:

1. Deploying a set of Snowplow-connected Arduinos to monitor the environment (temperature, humidity, light levels etc) in your home
2. Tracking the movement of products around your shop/warehouse/factory using Arduino, [RFID readers] [arduino-rfid] and Snowplow
3. Sending vehicle fleet information (locations, speeds, fuel levels etc) back to Snowplow using Arduino's [3G and GPS] [3g-gps] shields

In fact Alex has gone ahead and written a sample Arduino sketch to track temperatures and log the readings to Snowplow - you can find his project on GitHub at [alexanderdean/arduino-temp-tracker] [arduino-temp-tracker].
