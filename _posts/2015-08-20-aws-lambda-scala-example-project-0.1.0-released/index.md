We are pleased to announce the release of our new [AWS Lambda Scala Example Project] [repo]!

This is a simple time series analysis stream processing job written in Scala for [AWS Lambda] [aws-lambda-service], processing JSON events from [Amazon Kinesis] [kinesis] and writing aggregates to [Amazon DynamoDB] [dynamodb].

![data flow png][data-flow]

[AWS Lambda] [aws-lambda-service] can help you jumpstart your own real-time event processing pipeline, without having to setup and manage clusters of server infrastructure. We will take you through the steps to get this simple analytics-on-write job setup and processing your Kinesis event stream.

</div>

[AWS Lambda] [aws-lambda-service] is a compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the compute resources for you, making it easy to build applications that respond quickly to new information. AWS Lambda starts running your code within milliseconds of an event such as an image upload, in-app activity, website click, or output from a connected device. You can also use AWS Lambda to create new back-end services where compute resources are automatically triggered based on custom requests.

[Amazon Kinesis] [kinesis] is a fully managed service for real-time processing of streaming data at massive scale. In this project we leverage the integration between the Kinesis and Lambda services.

This is an example of the "pull" model where AWS Lambda polls the Amazon Kinesis stream and invokes your Lambda function when it detects new data on the stream.

<div class="html">
<h2><a name="introducting-analytics-on-write">2. Introducing analytics-on-write</a></h2>
</div>

Our AWS Lambda reads a Kinesis stream containing events in a JSON format:

{% highlight json %}
{
  "timestamp": "2015-06-30T12:54:43.064528",
  "eventType": "Green",
  "id": "4ec80fb1-0963-4e35-8f54-ce760499d974"
}
{% endhighlight %}

Our Scala Lambda counts the events by `eventType` and aggregates these counts into 1 minute buckets. The job then takes these aggregates and saves them into a table in DynamoDB:

![data table png][data-table]

The most complete open-source example of an analytics-on-write implementation is Ian Meyers' [amazon-kinesis-aggregators] [amazon-kinesis-aggregators] project; our example project is in turn heavily influenced by the concepts in Ian's work. Three important concepts to understand in analytics-on-write are:

1. **Downsampling** where we reduce the event's ISO 8601 timestamp down to minute precision, so for instance "2015-06-05T12:54:43.064528" becomes "2015-06-05T12:54:00.000000". This downsampling gives us a fast way of bucketing or aggregating events via this downsampled key
2. **Bucketing** is an aggregation technique that builds buckets, where each bucket is associated with a downstampled timestamp key and an event type criterion. By the end of the aggregation process, we’ll end up with a list of buckets - each one with a countable set of events that "belong" to it
3. **Atomic Increment** is useful for updating values as they change because multiple requests from your application won’t collide. If your application needs to increase a count by 100, you can just tell Amazon DynamoDB to automatically increment the count by 100 as opposed to having to get the record, increment the count, and put it back into Amazon DynamoDB

<h2><a name="detailed-setup">3. Detailed setup</a></h2>
</div>

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of getting up and running with Amazon Kinesis and AWS Lambda Service. You will need [git] [git-install], [Vagrant] [vagrant-install] and [VirtualBox] [virtualbox-install] installed locally. This project is specifically configured to run in AWS region "us-east-1" to ensure all AWS services are available.

<h3>Step 1: Build the project</h3>

First clone the repo and bring up Vagrant:

{% highlight bash %}
host$ git clone https://github.com/snowplow/aws-lambda-scala-example-project.git
host$ cd aws-lambda-scala-example-project/
host$ vagrant up && vagrant ssh
guest$ cd /vagrant
guest$ sbt assembly
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Step 2: Add AWS credentials to the Vagrant box</h3>

You're going to need IAM-based credentials for AWS. Get your keys and type in "aws configure" in the Vagrant box (the guest). In the below, I'm also setting the region to "us-east-1" and output formaat to "json":

{% highlight bash %}
$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: ADD_YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: ADD_YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE
Default region name [None]: us-east-1
Default output format [None]: json
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Step 3: Create your DynamoDB table, IAM role, and Kinesis stream</h3>

We're going to set up a DynamoDB table, IAM role (via CloudFormation), and a Kinesis stream. We will be using Python's `inv` to run all of our tasks. I'm using "my-table" as the table name. The CloudFormation stack name is "LambdaStack" and the Kinesis stream name is "my-stream". We will kick off this tutorial with the first command to create our Kinesis event stream:

{% highlight bash %}
$ inv create_kinesis_stream my-stream
Kinesis Stream [my-stream] not active yet
Kinesis Stream [my-stream] not active yet
Kinesis Stream [my-stream] not active yet
Kinesis successfully created.
{% endhighlight %}

Now create our DynamoDB table:

{% highlight bash %}
$ inv create_dynamodb_table default us-east-1 my-table
{% endhighlight %}

Now we can create our IAM role. We will be using CloudFormation to make our new role. Using `inv create_role`, we can create it like so:

{% highlight bash %}
$ inv create_role
arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:84412349716:stack/LambdaStack/23a341eb0-4162-11e5-9d4f-0150b34c7c
Creating roles

Giving Lambda proper permissions
Trying...
Created role
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Step 4: Upload project jar to Amazon S3</h3>

In the very first set, we "assembled" and compiled our Scala project files into a self contained jar. SBT built our jar file and put it into target folder here: `./target/scala-2.11/aws-lambda-scala-example-project-0.1.0`.
With the next `inv` command we will create a new bucket on S3 called `aws_scala_lambda_bucket`. The jar file will then be uploaded under the S3 key `aws-lambda-scala-example-project-0.1.0`.

Be patient while the uploader copies your multi-megabyte jar file to S3 with the following task:

{% highlight bash %}
$ inv upload_s3
Jar uploaded to S3 bucket aws_scala_lambda_bucket
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Step 5: Configure AWS Lambda service</h3>

Now that we have built the project, and uploaded the jar file to the AWS Lambda service, we need to configure the Lambda service to watch for event traffic from our AWS Kinesis stream named `my-stream`. This command will connect to the Lambda service and create our Lambda function called `ProcessingKinesisLambdaDynamoDB`. Don't worry, we are getting close to sending events to Kinesis!

{% highlight bash %}
$ inv create_lambda
Creating AWS Lambda function.
{
    "FunctionName": "ProcessingKinesisLambdaDynamoDB",
    "CodeSize": 38042279,
    "MemorySize": 1024,
    "FunctionArn": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:842349429716:function:ProcessingKinesisLambdaDynamoDB",
    "Handler": "com.snowplowanalytics.awslambda.LambdaFunction::recordHandler",
    "Role": "arn:aws:iam::842340234716:role/LambdaStack-LambdaExecRole-7G57P4M2VV5P",
    "Timeout": 60,
    "LastModified": "2015-08-13T19:39:46.730+0000",
    "Runtime": "java8",
    "Description": ""
}
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Step 6: Associate our Kinesis stream to our Lambda</h3>

Our Lambda function processes incoming event data from our Kinesis stream. AWS Lambda polls the Amazon Kinesis stream and invokes your Lambda function when it detects new data on the stream.

If you go to the AWS Lambda console webpage and select the Monitor tab, you can see the output log information in the Amazon CloudWatch service.  

We need to "connect" or "associate" our Lambda function to our Kinesis by:

{% highlight bash %}
$ inv configure_lambda my-stream
Configured AWS Lambda Service
Added Kinesis as event source for Lambda function
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Step 7: Generate events in your Kinesis stream</h3>

The final step for testing this project is to start sending some events to our new Kinesis stream. We have created a helper method to do this - run the below and leave it running in a separate terminal:

{% highlight bash %}
$ inv generate_events default us-east-1 my-stream
Event sent to Kinesis: {"timestamp": "2015-06-30T12:54:43.064528", "type": "Green", "id": "4ec80fb1-0963-4e35-8f54-ce760499d974"}
Event sent to Kinesis: {"timestamp": "2015-06-30T12:54:43.757797", "type": "Red", "id": "eb84b0d1-f793-4213-8a65-2fb09eab8c5c"}
Event sent to Kinesis: {"timestamp": "2015-06-30T12:54:44.295972", "type": "Yellow", "id": "4654bdc8-86d4-44a3-9920-fee7939e2582"}
...
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Step 8: Inspect the "my-table" aggregates in DynamoDB</h3>

Success! You can now see data being written to the table in DynamoDB. Make sure you are in the correct AWS region, then click on `my-table` and hit the `Explore Table` button:

![data table png][data-table]

For each **Timestamp** and **EventType** pair, we see a **Count**, plus some **CreatedAt** and **UpdatedAt** metadata for debugging purposes. Our bucket size is 1 minute, and we have 5 discrete event types, hence the matrix of rows that we see.

<h3>Step 9: Shut everything down</h3>

Remember to shut off:

* Kill the Python invoke event loading script
* Delete your `LambdaStack` Cloudstack
* Delete your `my-stream` Kinesis stream
* Delete your `my-table` DynamoDB table
* Delete your `ProcessingKinesisLambdaDynamoDB` function in AWS Lambda
* Delete your `cloudwatch` logs associated to the Lambda function
* Exit your Vagrant guest
* `vagrant halt`
* `vagrant destroy`

This example project is a direct port of our [AWS Lambda Node.js Example Project] [aws-lambda-example-project], which in turn was based on our [Spark Streaming Example Project] [spark-streaming-eg-blog]. If you want to see this approach implemented in different languages or processing frameworks, definitely check those out!

All three of these example projects are based on an event processing technique called _analytics-on-write_. We are planning on exploring these techniques further in a new project, called [Icebucket] [icebucket]. Stay tuned for more on this!
