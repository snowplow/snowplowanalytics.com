Astute readers of this blog have probably noticed a regular new author - we are hugely excited to introduce Anton Parkhomenko to the Snowplow team!

[Anton] [anton-bio] joined us as a [Data Engineering intern this summer] [summer-interns] to launch our new [Schema Guru] [schema-guru] project. Anton was already an experienced software engineer; for him the Snowplow internship was about getting his first professional experience in Scala and Functional Programming, plus gaining exposure to Big Data technologies and open source project practices.

After a highly successful internship, which saw the release of Schema Guru versions [0.1.0] [schema-guru-010-post] thru [0.3.0] [schema-guru-030-post], we were delighted to make Anton an offer to join the Snowplow Data Engineering team full-time.

Since then, Anton has worked on quite a variety of key releases, including:

* The [Snowplow Scala Tracker] [snowplow-scala-tracker], version 0.2.0
* Another Schema Guru release, [0.4.0] [schema-guru-040-post], with Apache Spark support
* The release of [Scala Weather] [scala-weather-post], and now [Snowplow R74] [snowplow-r74-post] which leverages this in the Weather Enrichment

Currently Anton is working on all-new event enrichments, which promise to make Snowplow an ever-more flexible platform for your event analytics. Watch this space!

Welcome to the team Anton!
