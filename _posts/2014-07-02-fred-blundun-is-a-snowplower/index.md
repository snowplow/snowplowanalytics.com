You have probably seen a new name behind blog posts, new software releases and email threads recently: we are hugely excited to introduce (somewhat belatedly!) Fred Blundun to the team!

![fred-img] [fred-img]

Fred joined us a Data Engineer this spring. Fred is a Mathematics graduate from Cambridge University; data engineering at Snowplow is his first full-time role in software.

Fred hit the ground running at Snowplow with some great new tracker releases, including:

* The [Snowplow Python Tracker] [snowplow-python-tracker] versions 0.2.0 thru 0.4.0
* The [Snowplow Ruby Tracker] [snowplow-ruby-tracker]'s initial release
* The [Snowplow JavaScript Tracker] [snowplow-javascript-tracker] - multiple releases culminating in the major update [version 2.0.0] [js-tracker-200] just announced

Fred also co-authored our recent designs for [SchemaVer] [schemaver] and [self-describing JSONs] [self-describing-jsons], which have been instrumental in architecting [Iglu] [iglu].

He is now working on an overhaul of our event enrichment engine in Snowplow core, coming soon.

Welcome to the team Fred!
