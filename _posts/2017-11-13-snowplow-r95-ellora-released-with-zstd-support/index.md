We are excited to announce the release of [Snowplow R95 Ellora][snowplow-release].

This release is primarily focused on updates to the `atomic.events` table for Redshift users, with
a much-anticipated switch to the ZSTD encoding. This change in column encoding should lead to significant
reductions in the disk space used by `atomic.events` for all of our users who load their Snowplow to
Redshift.

If you’d like to know more about R95 Ellora, named after an [archaeological site in India][ellora]),

<h2 id="zstd">1. Updating atomic.events to use ZSTD compression</h2>

Since AWS added ZSTD support for Redshift earlier this year, we have been very interested in
applying it to our `atomic.events` table for the potential reductions in used disk space
(see issue [#3435][i3435]). Our tests have been successful: we’ve found the tradeoff in terms
of performance to be negligible across a variety of query types; and we’ve found that
applying ZSTD to `atomic.events` typically leads to a ~60% reduction in size on disk.

Huge thanks to [Mike Robins][miike] who led the charge on ZSTD support with his excellent
[RFC][zstd-rfc] and the accompanying pull requests.

To help with the migration, we have written [a migration script][migration-script], along with the
[new table definition][table-definition].

For more information on ZSTD compression, please check out the relevant [AWS documentation][aws-zstd].

<h2 id="sessionidx">2. Update domain_sessionidx column in atomic.events to accept larger values</h2>

Some websites with highly active bots have faced issues with the `domain_sessionidx` column in Redshift, because of values higher than `32767` exceeding the upper bound of the `SMALLINT` Redshift column. Using `SMALLINT` here is technically a bug, because the underlying field in Snowplow is in fact a Java `Integer`, with a range of -2147483648 to 2147483647.

To resolve this, we have updated the `domain_sessionidx` column in Redshift to be a Redshift `INTEGER` (see issue [#1788][i1788]). A Redshift `INTEGER` supports the same value range as a Java `Integer`.

<h2 id="cloudfront">3. Support for the updated Cloudfront access log format</h2>

Late last year Amazon added a 24th field to [the CloudFront log file format][cf-format]:
`cs-protocol-version`. As a result, rows found in the access logs of CloudFront distributions would fail
enrichment as being unrecognized. This has been fixed in this release.

<h2 id="misc">4. Under the hood</h2>

<h3 id="url-parsing">4.1 Relaxing `page_url` parsing</h3>

With some events failing validation due to URLs containing more than one `#` character, we have now relaxed the parsing of those URLs (see issue [#2893][i2893]). This was rolled out in the real-time pipeline in R93, and is now coming to Spark Enrich in this release.

<h3 id="spark">4.2 Upgrading our Spark jobs to Spark 2.2.0</h3>

In our ongoing effort to benefit from the latest performance improvements in Spark, we have updated
our Enrich and Shred jobs to run on Spark 2.2.0.

Support for Spark 2.2.0 was only introduced in [EMR AMI 5.9.0][emr-ami], so you will need to update the AMI version used in EmrEtlRunner, as explained in the upgrade guide below.

<h3 id="overwrite">4.3 Overwriting output datasets</h3>

Since the Enrich and Shred jobs are idempotent, we are now allowing overwrites of existing data for
a particular run. This is especially useful during a transient failure so that YARN can retry
a job multiple times.

This makes the `yarn.resourcemanager.am.max-attempts: "1"` configuration settings, which we previously recommended, optional from now on.

There is a good discussion on the subject on [our Discourse forum][discourse-already-exists].

<h3 id="web-model">4.4 Moving the web model to its own repository</h3>

Finally, note that this release moves the web model to its own repository, [snowplow/web-data-model][web-data-model].

This should allow us to evolve the web data model independently of Snowplow itself, accelerating the release cadence here.

<h2 id="upgrading">5. Upgrading</h2>

<h3 id="redshift">5.1 Upgrading your Redshift database</h3>

Due to it not being possible to modify the compression of table columns in Redshift, a deep copy is
required in order to migrate an already-existing `atomic.events` table to ZSTD.

We recommend that you have **at least 50% Redshift storage space remaining** prior to upgrading your `atomic.events` table. It may be the case that you have to temporarily resize your cluster and/or pause your pipeline in order to make the switch.

The resources are as follows:

- [The migration script][migration-script] has been specifically written to update the latest v0.8.0
`atomic.events` table to v0.9.0
- The new atomic.events table definition can be found [here][table-definition]

<h3 id="emr">5.2 Upgrading EmrEtlRunner</h3>

The latest version of EmrEtlRunner is available from our Bintray [here][eer-dl].

To use the latest job versions, make the following changes to your EmrEtlRunner configuration:

{% highlight yaml %}
aws:
  # ...
  emr:
    ami_version: 5.9.0        # WAS 5.5.0
    # ...
enrich:
  version:
    spark_enrich: 1.10.0      # WAS 1.9.0
storage:
  versions:
    rdb_loader: 0.14.0        # WAS 0.13.0
    rdb_shredder: 0.13.0      # WAS 0.12.0
{% endhighlight %}

For a complete example, see our sample [`config.yml`][config-yml] template.

<h3 id="resolver">5.3 Updating your Iglu resolver</h3>

We are now operating a mirror of Iglu Central on Google Cloud Platform, to maintain high availability in
the case of a chronic AWS outage. To make use of this mirror, add the following registry to your
Iglu resolver JSON file:

{% highlight json %}
{
  "name": "Iglu Central - GCP Mirror",
  "priority": 1,
  "vendorPrefixes": [ "com.snowplowanalytics" ],
  "connection": {
    "http": {
      "uri": "http://mirror01.iglucentral.com"
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<h2 id="roadmap">6. Roadmap</h2>

Upcoming Snowplow releases will include:

* [R96 [STR] Zeugma][r96], which will add support for NSQ to the stream processing pipeline, ready
for adoption in Snowplow Mini
* [R9x [STR] Priority fixes][r9x-str-quality], removing the potential for data loss in the stream
processing pipeline
* [R9x [BAT] 4 webhooks][r9x-webhooks], which will add support for 4 new webhooks (Mailgun, Olark,
Unbounce, StatusGator)

<h2 id="help">7. Getting Help</h2>
