Two and a half weeks ag ago the Snowplow team was out in the beautiful city of Budapest for the inaugural [Snowplow Meetup Budapest][budapest-meetup].

The event was kicked off with an awesome presentation from [Gabor Ratky][gabor], CTO at [Secret Sauce Partners][secret-sauce-partners], one of our earliest adopters. Gabor discussed the journey that the Secret Sauce team had been on, and how they came to Snowplow after trying a number of alternatives including Mixpanel, Kissmetrics and building their own platform. You can view his slides below:

Gabor's presentation was followed up by our own [Christophe Bogaert][christophe] on data modeling. You can view his presentation below:
