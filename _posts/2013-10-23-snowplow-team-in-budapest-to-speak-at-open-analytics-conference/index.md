We are thrilled to be going to Budapest this November, where I've kindly been invited to speak at the [Budapest BI Forum] [budapest-bi-forum] on Snowplow, on a day dedicated to [Open Analytics] [open-analytics-day].

Budapest is home to a thriving community of tech-savvy companies. We are very keen to meet as many of them as possible whilst we're in Budapest - so if you're based in Budapest (or visiting for the conference), and would like to sit down with us, then [give us a shout][contact]! We'll be in Budapest between November 5th and the 8th.
