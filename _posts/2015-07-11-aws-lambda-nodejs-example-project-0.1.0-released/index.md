We are pleased to announce the release of our new [AWS Lambda Node.js Example Project] [repo]!

This is a simple time series analysis stream processing job written in Node.js for [AWS Lambda] [aws-lambda-service], processing JSON events from [Amazon Kinesis] [kinesis] and writing aggregates to [Amazon DynamoDB] [dynamodb].

![data flow png][data-flow]

The [AWS Lambda] [aws-lambda-service] can help you jumpstart your own real-time event processing pipeline, without having to setup and manage clusters of server infrastructure. We will take you through the steps to get this simple analytics-on-write job setup and processing your Kinesis event stream.

</div>

[AWS Lambda] [aws-lambda-service] is a compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the compute resources for you, making it easy to build applications that respond quickly to new information. AWS Lambda starts running your code within milliseconds of an event such as an image upload, in-app activity, website click, or output from a connected device. You can also use AWS Lambda to create new back-end services where compute resources are automatically triggered based on custom requests.

[Amazon Kinesis] [kinesis] is a fully managed service for real-time processing of streaming data at massive scale. In this project we leverage the integration between the Kinesis and Lambda services.

This is an example of the "pull" model where AWS Lambda polls the Amazon Kinesis stream and invokes your Lambda function when it detects new data on the stream.

<div class="html">
<h2><a name="introducting-analytics-on-write">2. Introducing analytics-on-write</a></h2>
</div>

Our AWS Lambda reads a Kinesis stream containing events in a JSON format:

{% highlight json %}
{
  "timestamp": "2015-06-30T12:54:43.064528",
  "type": "Green",
  "id": "4ec80fb1-0963-4e35-8f54-ce760499d974"
}
{% endhighlight %}

Our Node.js Lambda counts the events by `type` and aggregates these counts into 1 minute buckets. The job then takes these aggregates and saves them into a table in DynamoDB:

![data table png][data-table]

The most complete open-source example of an analytics-on-write implementation is Ian Meyers' [amazon-kinesis-aggregators] [amazon-kinesis-aggregators] project; our example project is in turn heavily influenced by the concepts in Ian's work. Three important concepts to understand in analytics-on-write are:

1. **Downsampling** where we reduce the event's ISO 8601 timestamp down to minute precision, so for instance "2015-06-05T12:54:43.064528" becomes "2015-06-05T12:54:00.000000". This downsampling gives us a fast way of bucketing or aggregating events via this downsampled key
2. **Bucketing** is an aggregation technique that builds buckets, where each bucket is associated with a downstampled timestamp key and an event type criterion. By the end of the aggregation process, we’ll end up with a list of buckets - each one with a countable set of events that "belong" to it
3. **Atomic Increment** is useful for updating values as they change because multiple requests from your application won’t collide. If your application needs to increase a count by 100, you can just tell Amazon DynamoDB to automatically increment the count by 100 as opposed to having to get the record, increment the count, and put it back into Amazon DynamoDB

<div class="html">
<h2><a name="detailed-setup">3. Detailed setup</a></h2>
</div>

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of getting up and running with Amazon Kinesis and AWS Lambda Service. You will need [git] [git-install], [Vagrant] [vagrant-install] and [VirtualBox] [virtualbox-install] installed locally. This project is specifically configured to run in AWS region "us-east-1" to ensure all AWS services are available.

<h3>Step 1: Build the project</h3>

First clone the repo and bring up Vagrant:

{% highlight bash %}
host$ git clone https://github.com/snowplow/aws-lambda-nodejs-example-project.git
host$ cd aws-lambda-example-project
host$ vagrant up && vagrant ssh
{% endhighlight %}

Before we go any further we will have to set up our project enviroment. We will install **Grunt** and project dependencies with the commands below:

{% highlight bash %}
guest$ cd /vagrant
guest# npm install grunt
guest$ npm install
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Step 2: Add AWS credentials to the vagrant box</h3>

You're going to need IAM-based credentials for AWS. Get your keys and type in "aws configure" in the Vagrant box (the guest). In the below, I'm also setting the region to "us-east-1" and output formaat to "json":

{% highlight bash %}
$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: ADD_YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: ADD_YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE
Default region name [None]: us-east-1
Default output format [None]: json
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Step 3: Create your DynamoDB, IAM Role, and Kinesis stream</h3>

We're going to set up a DynamoDB table, IAM role (via CloudFormation), and a Kinesis stream. We will be using Grunt to run all of our tasks. I'm using "my-table" as the table name. The CloudFormation stack name is "kinesisDynamo" and the Kinesis stream name is "my-stream". We will kick off all of the tasks with the `grunt init` command:

{% highlight bash %}
$ grunt init
Running "dynamo:default" (dynamo) task
{ TableDescription:
   { AttributeDefinitions: [ [Object], [Object], [Object] ],
     CreationDateTime: Sun Jun 28 2015 13:04:02 GMT-0700 (PDT),
     ItemCount: 0,
     KeySchema: [ [Object], [Object] ],
     LocalSecondaryIndexes: [ [Object] ],
     ProvisionedThroughput:
      { NumberOfDecreasesToday: 0,
        ReadCapacityUnits: 20,
        WriteCapacityUnits: 20 },
     TableName: 'my-table',
     TableSizeBytes: 0,
     TableStatus: 'CREATING' } }

Running "createRole:default" (createRole) task
{ ResponseMetadata: { RequestId: 'd29asdff0-1dd0-11e5-984e-35a24700edda' },
  StackId: 'arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:84asdf429716:stack/kinesisDynamo/d2af8730-1dd0-11e5-854a-50d5017c76e0' }

Running "kinesis:default" (kinesis) task
{}

Done, without errors.
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Step 4: Build Node.js project and configure AWS Lambda</h3>

Grunt can also package our project's code into `dist/aws-lambda-example-project_0-1-0_latest.zip`; this task also attaches the IAM role to AWS Lambda.

Invoke the task with:

{% highlight bash %}
$ grunt role
Running "attachRole:default" (attachRole) task
{ ResponseMetadata: { RequestId: '36ac7877-1dca-11e5-b439-d1da60d122be' } }

Running "packaging:default" (packaging) task

Created package at dist/aws-lambda-example-project_0-1-0_latest.zip
...
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Step 5: Deploy the package to AWS Lambda</h3>

Deploy this project to Lambda with the `grunt deploy` command:

{% highlight bash %}
$ grunt deploy
Running "lambda_deploy:default" (lambda_deploy) task
Trying to create AWS Lambda Function...
Created AWS Lambda Function...
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Step 6: Associate our Kinesis stream to our Lambda</h3>

Our Lambda function reads incoming event data and logs some of the information to Amazon CloudWatch. AWS Lambda polls the Amazon Kinesis stream and invokes your Lambda function when it detects new data on the stream. We need to "connect" or "associate" our Lambda function to Kinesis by:

{% highlight bash %}
$ grunt connect
Running "associateStream:default" (associateStream) task
arn:aws:kinesis:us-east-1:844709429716:stream/my-stream
{ BatchSize: 100,
  EventSourceArn: 'arn:aws:kinesis:us-east-1:2349429716:stream/my-stream',
  FunctionArn: 'arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:2349429716:function:ProcessKinesisRecordsDynamo',
  LastModified: Sun Jun 28 2015 12:38:37 GMT-0700 (PDT),
  LastProcessingResult: 'No records processed',
  State: 'Creating',
  StateTransitionReason: 'User action',
  UUID: 'f4efc-fe72-4337-9907-89d4e64c' }

Done, without errors.
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Step 7: Generate events in your Kinesis stream</h3>

The final step for testing this project is to start sending some events to our new Kinesis stream. We have created a helper method to do this - run the below and leave it running in a separate terminal:

{% highlight bash %}
$ grunt events
Event sent to Kinesis: {"timestamp": "2015-06-30T12:54:43.064528", "type": "Green", "id": "4ec80fb1-0963-4e35-8f54-ce760499d974"}
Event sent to Kinesis: {"timestamp": "2015-06-30T12:54:43.757797", "type": "Red", "id": "eb84b0d1-f793-4213-8a65-2fb09eab8c5c"}
Event sent to Kinesis: {"timestamp": "2015-06-30T12:54:44.295972", "type": "Yellow", "id": "4654bdc8-86d4-44a3-9920-fee7939e2582"}
...
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Step 8: Inspect the "my-table" aggregates in DynamoDB</h3>

Success! You can now see data being written to the table in DynamoDB. Make sure you are in the correct AWS region, then click on `my-table` and hit the `Explore Table` button:

![data table png][data-table]

For each **Timestamp** and **EventType** pair, we see a **Count**, plus some **CreatedAt** and **UpdatedAt** metadata for debugging purposes. Our bucket size is 1 minute, and we have 5 discrete event types, hence the matrix of rows that we see.

<h3>Step 9: Shut everything down</h3>

Remember to shut off:

* grunt events loading script
* Delete your `kinesisDynamo` Cloudstack
* Delete your `my-stream` Kinesis stream
* Delete your `my-table` DynamoDB table
* Delete your `ProcessingKinesisLambdaDynamoDB` function in AWS Lambda
* Delete your `cloudwatch` logs associated to the Lambda function
* Exit your Vagrant guest
* `vagrant halt`
* `vagrant destroy`

This example project is a direct port of our [Spark Streaming Example Project] [spark-streaming-eg-blog] - if you are interested in Spark Streaming or Scala, definitely check it out!

Both example projects are based on an event processing technique called _analytics-on-write_. We are planning on exploring these techniques further in a new project, called [Icebucket] [icebucket]. Stay tuned for more on this!
