We manage our health through connected devices. We read novels, keep up with the news, order food and book holidays online. We find work through digital platforms and use online services to perform and deliver that work. Digital platforms are integral in the fabric of our everyday lives.</p>

            <p class="spacer-bottom-40">It is hard to use data to differentiate. It requires both creative and technical excellence: creativity, because every great insight starts with asking a clever question. Technical excellence, because using data to answer questions requires technical know how.</p>
            <p class="spacer-bottom-40">Technology cannot help with the creative piece: for that you need Smart People. But it can help with the technical. We build technology that puts Smart People in control of their data so they can do what they want with it, unconstrained by assumptions about what data they 'should'  collect, what questions they 'should' ask, what insight they 'should' build and how they 'should' act on that insight. We empower Smart People to do data differently and be better than the rest.</p>
