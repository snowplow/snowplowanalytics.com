<h2>How we use that data</h2>

<p>There are two ways we use the data that that we collect:</p>

<h3>1. To optimise the effectiveness of our website</h3>

<p>Our website is a resource for:
	<ul>
		<li><b>Prospective users of our technology and services</b>, who are interested in learning more so that they can make well-informed buying decisions.</b></li>
		<li><b>Current users of our technology (including open source technology) and services</b>, who are interested in getting more information so that they can effectively use our technology and services.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>Ensuring that our website serves the needs of both of the above groups of visitors is important both for visitors to our websites (they get a good experience) and ourselves (so we can win and retain customers).</p>

<h3>2. To market to prospective users who are interested in learning more about our technology and services</h3>

<p>A certain subset of visitors to our website are prospective rather than current Snowplow users, who have come to our website to learn more about our technology and services.</p>

<p>For these users who are interested, we want to be able to send them additional information: for example, if they have consumed information about data protection and GDPR, and we have just released some new functionality to help them meet their obligations under GDPR, we would like to be able to send them that information in an email.</p>

<p>It is very important to us that we <i>only</i> send additional information to users who are happy to receive the information, and in the event that an individual no longer wishes to receive targeted communciation from us, we stop sending that information and remove their data if requested. More information on how we do this in practice can be found <a href="#how-we-ensure-data-use-is-used-correctly">below</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-ensure-data-use-is-used-correctly">How we ensure that our use of all data collected is compatible with the rights and preferences of our website visitors</h2>
