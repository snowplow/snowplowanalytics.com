      title: Formal validation
      content: All data collected is validated against its associated data schemas. You can configure schemas to be as strict as you like, making it easy to proactively identify data quality issues e.g. a value being stored in the wrong field.
    - icon: /assets/img/data/insights-data_quality_2.svg
      title: Loss-less<br>data pipeline
      content: No events sent to the Snowplow pipeline are silently “dropped”. If there is an issue processing the data, we surface it with the associated error messages, so you can easily monitor and proactively identify data quality issues as they emerge, rather than after the fact.
    - icon: /assets/img/data/insights-data_quality_3.svg
      title: Fully auditable
      content: You have direct access to the data at every stage in the Snowplow data pipeline, enabling you to audit the data quality at each stage and validate that no data has been lost or incorrectly transformed.
    - icon: /assets/img/data/insights-data_quality_4.svg
      title: Recover and reprocess<br>bad data
      content: It is possible to recover and reprocess bad data, so that data tracking issues do not necessarily need to result in gaps in your data collection.

      content: No one in digital analytics talks about bad data. A lot about working with data is sexy, but managing bad data, i.e. working to improve data quality, is not. Not only is talking about bad data not sexy, it is really awkward, because it forces us to confront a hard truth.
    - title: <a href="/blog/2018/12/19/debugging-bad-data-in-gcp-with-bigquery/">Debugging bad data in GCP with BigQuery</a>
      content: One of the key features of the Snowplow pipeline is that it’s architected to ensure data quality up front - rather than spending a lot of time cleaning and making sense of the data before using it, schemas are defined up front and used to validate data as it comes through the pipeline. 
    - title: <a href="/blog/2016/03/03/guide-to-debugging-bad-data-in-elasticsearch-kibana/">Debugging bad data in Elasticsearch and Kibana</a>
      content: "One of the features that makes Snowplow unique is that we actually report bad data: any data that hits the Snowplow pipeline and fails to be processed successfully. This is incredibly valuable, because it means you can spot data tracking issues that emerge, quickly, and address them at source."
