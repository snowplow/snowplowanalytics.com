</p>
<p>

    person to):
</p>
<p>
    2.3.1 reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile or translate any Product, or

    under applicable mandatory law without possibility of contractual waiver;
</p>
<p>

    2.3.2 resell, on-provide or otherwise make the benefit of the Products
    available to any third party (provided that this clause

    2.3.2 will not prevent the Customer making the benefit of the Products
    available to its Affiliates in furtherance of its group internal business
    purposes) unless permitted to do so in the relevant Order Form, and
    provided always that the Customer may not use any Product to compete,
    directly or indirectly, with Snowplow; or
</p>
<p>
    2.3.3 use or deal with any Product in any way which is unlawful in any
    relevant jurisdiction, or to process any Customer Data which is unlawful,
    defamatory, harassing, obscene
</p>
<h2>
    3 Software Licence
</h2>
<p>
    3.1 This clause 3 applies if and only to the extent that the relevant
    Product includes Software.
</p>
<p>
    3.2 Snowplow grants to the Customer a non-exclusive, non-assignable
        licence to Use the Software as part of the Product from the Effective
        Date until Termination, only for the Customer’s own internal business
        purposes.
</p>
<p>
    3.3 Snowplow expressly reserves the right to incorporate into the Software
    any modifications, extensions or improvements to the Software it may create
    (in the course of providing Data Analytics and Data Engineering Services or
    otherwise) and to make such modifications, extensions and/or improvements
    generally available.
</p>
<p>
    3.4 Snowplow may ship or otherwise make available with the Software certain
    Open Source Software. The Open Source Software is not part of the Software,
    and is licensed on the terms set out or referred to in Snowplow’s Open
    Source Statement, but (to the extent relevant) Snowplow will provide
    Support for the Open Source Software as if it were part of the Software
    (and subject therefore to the Support entitlement comprised in the relevant
    Product).
</p>
<h2>
    4 Hosted Services

    ensure that the Hosted Services are available, the Customer acknowledging
    and agreeing that:
</p>
<p>
    4.3.1 the availability of the Hosted Services is subject to periodic
    scheduled maintenance and occasional emergency maintenance; and
</p>
<p>
    4.3.2 the Hosted Services are dependent upon AWS and/or other third party
    cloud providers which are beyond Snowplow’s ability to control, and that
    Snowplow will consequently have no liability to the Customer arising out of
    or in connection with unavailability or slow performance of the Hosted
    Services attributable to AWS and/or such other third party providers.
</p>
<h2>
    5 Support
</h2>
<p>
    5.1 This clause 5 applies if and only to the extent that the relevant
    Product includes Support.
</p>
<p>
    5.2 Snowplow will use its reasonable efforts to provide Support in
    accordance with its support policy as set out in the applicable Product
    Description. The Customer acknowledges and agrees that the support policy
    is subject to change from time to time, provided that if during the Initial
    Term Snowplow changes it in a way which results in a significantly lower
    level of Support for the relevant Product, then those changes will not come
    into effect as against the Customer until the start of the Further Term.
</p>
<p>
    5.3 Where the scope of Support (as set out in the Product Description)
    includes initial set-up, Snowplow will, subject to the Customer’s
    cooperation and compliance with Snowplow’s instructions, perform that
    initial set-up within a reasonable time.
</p>
<h2>
    6 Data Analytics and Data Engineering Services
</h2>
<p>
    6.1 Subject to payment by the Customer of the applicable Charges and
    performance by the Customer of the Customer Dependencies, Snowplow will:
</p>
<p>
    6.1.1 perform the Data Analytics and Data Engineering Services selected on
    the Order Form (and as further described in the Statement of Work, if
    applicable) with reasonable skill and care;
</p>
<p>
    6.1.2 use reasonable efforts to complete the Data Analytics and Data
    Engineering Services within the Customer’s requested timeframes, but time
    will not be of the essence; and
</p>
<p>
    6.1.3 where Snowplow personnel work at the Customer’s premises in the
    course of providing the Data Analytics and Data Engineering Services,
    comply with (a) the Customer’s written policies and procedures provided to
    Snowplow in advance of such visit; and (b) the Customer’s reasonable
    instructions in respect of the conduct of Snowplow’s personnel while at the
    Customer’s premises, and the Customer will accordingly ensure that it
    provides such Snowplow personnel with a safe and lawful working
    environment.
</p>
<p>
    6.2 Where the Data Analytics and Data Engineering Services entail
    integrating a Product with third party software and/or services, Snowplow
    will not be responsible for any failure or delay which is wholly or mainly
    caused by defects in such third party software and/or services, or the
    failure of any relevant third party vendor or supplier to provide
    reasonable cooperation and assistance. Any new or increased charges levied
    by any third party vendor or supplier by reason of providing such
    cooperation and assistance will be the sole responsibility of the Customer.
</p>
<p>
    6.3 Where Snowplow personnel are required to travel in order to perform
    Data Analytics and Data Engineering Services, the Customer will reimburse
    Snowplow for such personnel’s out of pocket costs and expenses, provided
    that:
</p>
<p>
    6.3.1 they are reasonably incurred and reasonable in amount; and
</p>
<p>
    6.3.2 the Customer has approved them in advance.
</p>
<h2>
    7 Charges
</h2>
<p>
    7.1 Snowplow will invoice the Customer as follows:
</p>
<p>
    7.1.1 for the initial setup Charges (if any) in respect of a Product, on or
    shortly after the Effective Date or (if relevant) on or shortly after Go
    Live for the relevant Product;
</p>
<p>
    7.1.2 for the recurring Charges in respect of a Product, monthly in advance
    on or shortly after the first working day of each month; and
</p>
<p>
    7.1.3 for Data Analytics and Data Engineering Services in full in advance
    or as otherwise specified in the Statement of Work (if any).
</p>
<p>
    7.2 The Customer will pay each invoice in full within 30 days of receipt.
</p>
<p>
    7.3 All Charges are exclusive of VAT. Where VAT is payable in respect of
    any Charges, Snowplow will add VAT to its invoice at the appropriate rate,
    and the Customer will pay such VAT together with such Charges.
</p>
<p>
    7.4 If the Customer has not paid an invoice by its due date for payment,
    Snowplow may charge interest, from the date on which payment was due until
    the actual date of payment (whether before or after judgment), at a rate of
    1 per cent. per month above the official dealing rate of the Bank of
    England, accruing daily. The Customer will pay the accrued interest
    together with the overdue amount.
</p>
<p>
    7.5 The Customer will pay all amounts due to Snowplow under this Agreement
    in full and without any set-off, counterclaim, deduction or withholding
    (other than any deduction or withholding of tax required by law, in respect
    of which the Customer will make the relevant payment to the relevant tax
    authority and provide Snowplow with the appropriate certification that it
    has done so, such that Snowplow can recover the withheld amounts under
    applicable double taxation treaties).
</p>
<p>
    7.6 At any point after the expiry of the Initial Term, Snowplow may adjust
    the Charges by notice in writing to the Customer. If the Charges are
    reduced, the new lower Charges will take effect from the next invoice date.
    If the Charges are increased, the new higher Charges will take effect on
    the invoice date falling 3 months after the date on which Snowplow notifies
    the Customer of the increase (the “<strong>Increase Date</strong>”). For
    clarity, any increase in the Charges is without prejudice to the Customer’s
    right to terminate for convenience under clause 15.2.
</p>
<h2>
    8 Representations and Warranties
</h2>
<p>
    8.1 Each of Snowplow and the Customer represents and warrants that:
</p>
<p>
    8.1.1 it is duly incorporated and validly existing;
</p>
<p>
    8.1.2 it has all necessary consents, approvals and authorities to enter
    into and perform this Agreement; and
</p>
<p>
    8.1.3 it is not insolvent or trading wrongfully, and has no reason to
    believe that it will become so during the Term.
</p>
<p>
    8.2 The Customer represents and warrants that the Customer Data does not
    contain any material which:
</p>
<p>
    8.2.1 is criminal, defamatory, obscene, otherwise unlawful, harassing of
    any person, or which tends to promote hatred or discrimination; or
</p>
<p>
    8.2.2 infringes the intellectual property rights or other rights of any
    party,
</p>
<p>
    and the Customer is deemed to repeat such representation and warranty on
    each occasion on which it processes (or causes to be processed) additional
    Customer Data using a Product.
</p>
<h2>
    9 Security
</h2>
<p>
    9.1 Snowplow will use reasonable care and skill to secure the Hosted
    Services. Snowplow will provide to the Customer such information about
    Snowplow’s security policies and practices as the Customer may reasonably
    request.
</p>
<p>
    9.2 Depending on the Product, Snowplow may have access to a sub-account
    within the Customer’s AWS infrastructure. In those cases, the Customer will
    ensure that it configures Snowplow’s AWS subaccount as specified by
    Snowplow and, in particular, grants no additional privileges to that AWS
    subaccount.
</p>
<p>
    9.3 Each of Snowplow and the Customer will keep the relevant account access
    credentials secure and will not disclose them to any other person. Where
    Snowplow and the Customer exchange access credentials, they will do so
    using PassPack. Each of Snowplow and the Customer will ensure that it uses
    PassPack correctly and in accordance with best security practice, and will
    ensure that it keeps its PassPack access credentials secure and does not
    disclose them to any other person.
</p>
<h2>
    10 Data protection
</h2>
<p>
    10.1 Terms defined in the Data Protection Act 1998 have the same meanings
    when used in this clause 10.
</p>
<p>
    10.2 Each of Snowplow and the Customer will comply with its respective
    obligations under the Data Protection Laws.
</p>
<p>
    10.3 Snowplow will, if requested to do so by the Customer, ensure that
    Customer Data which is processed by a Hosted Service is stored in a
    particular AWS region. Snowplow makes no representation as to the
    advisability of processing and storing Customer Data in one AWS region over
    another.
</p>
<p>
    10.4 Where Snowplow processes personal data (as data processor) on behalf
    of the Customer (as data controller) in connection with this Agreement,
    Snowplow will:
</p>
<p>
    10.4.1 take appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect
    those data against unauthorised or unlawful processing and accidental loss,
    destruction or damage;
</p>
<p>
    10.4.2 not process those data, and in particular (but without limitation)
    not disclose them to any person (other than a permitted subcontractor)
    except on the instructions of the Customer or as required by law or
    regulation;
</p>
<p>
    10.4.3 where those data are processed using an AWS region located within
    the European Economic Area, not transfer those data outside the European
    Economic Area except on the instructions of the Customer or as required by
    law or regulation; and
</p>
<p>
    10.4.4 promptly inform the Customer if it receives a request or notice from
    a data subject seeking to exercising his or her rights under the Data
    Protection Laws in respect of those data, and (at the Customer's cost)
    comply with the Customer's reasonable instructions with respect to that
    request or notice.
</p>
<p>
    10.5 The Customer hereby instructs Snowplow to take such steps in the
    processing of personal data on its behalf as Snowplow reasonably considers
    necessary to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement.
</p>
<p>
    10.6 Snowplow acknowledges that the Data Privacy Laws in certain
    jurisdictions may require additional contractual commitments between data
    controllers and data processors over and above the matters addressed above.
    Where that is the case, the Customer should contact Snowplow on
    data-protection@snowplowanalytics.com to discuss how best to address those
    requirements.
</p>
<h2>
    11 Intellectual Property and Confidential Information
</h2>
<p>
    11.1 Nothing in this Agreement will change the ownership of any of the
    intellectual property rights of either party. In particular, the Customer
    acknowledges that the Products (including the Software) and Snowplow’s
    know-how and expertise in performing Support and/or Data Analytics and Data
    Engineering Services are the valuable property and/or confidential
    information of Snowplow and/or its licensors, and that it may not make any
    use of them other than in order to receive the benefit of the Products.
</p>
<p>
    11.2 The Customer acknowledges that Snowplow has no control over the nature
    or content of the Customer Data, and the Customer will therefore indemnify
    Snowplow against any claim brought by a third party against Snowplow on the
    basis that Customer Data infringes a third party’s rights (including its
    intellectual property rights).
</p>
<h2>
    12 Liability
</h2>
<p>
    12.1 This clause 12 sets out Snowplow’s entire liability to the Customer
    under or in connection with this Agreement.
</p>
<p>
    12.2 Nothing in this agreement limits or excludes Snowplow's liability
        for:
</p>
<p>
    12.2.1 death or personal injury caused by its negligence; or
</p>
<p>
    12.2.2 fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.
</p>
<p>
    12.3 Subject to clause
    12.2, Snowplow will not have any liability to the Customer under or in
    connection with this Agreement for any: loss of profits or account of
    profits; loss of sales or business; loss of agreements or contracts; loss
    of opportunity; loss of anticipated savings; loss of or damage to goodwill;
    loss of use or corruption of data or information; or any indirect or
    consequential loss.
</p>
<p>
    12.4 Subject to clauses 12.2 and 12.3, Snowplow’s total liability to the
    Customer under or in connection with this Agreement will be limited, in
    respect of all claims (connected or unconnected) in any consecutive 12
    month period, to an amount equal to the Charges paid by the Customer in
    that period.
</p>
<h2>
    13 Third Party infringement Claims
</h2>
<p>
    13.1 If a third party asserts a claim against the Customer that the
        Customers' use of a Product infringes that third party's intellectual
        property rights (an "<strong>Infringement Claim</strong>"), then
        Snowplow will, at its own expense, defend or settle the Infringement
        Claim and pay any damages finally awarded against the Customer, or any
        settlement amount agreed between that third party and Snowplow in lieu
        of such damages, but only if:
</p>
<p>
    13.1.1 the Customer promptly notifies Snowplow of such Infringement Claim
    (and in any event within an amount of time sufficient to permit Snowplow to
    take appropriate action within the applicable time limits) and takes no
    action to admit, settle or otherwise dispose of such Infringement Claim
    without Snowplow's prior written consent;
</p>
<p>
    13.1.2 Snowplow retains sole control of the defence of such Infringement
    Claim and all negotiations for its settlement or compromise (including free
    choice of counsel, other professional advisers and experts); and
</p>
<p>
    13.1.3 the Customer provides all reasonable assistance requested by
    Snowplow or its professional advisers,
</p>
<p>
    and in each case solely to the extent that the Infringement Claim is based
    on an allegation of infringement by some element of a Product.
</p>
<p>
    13.2 Snowplow’s obligations in clause 13.1 above will not apply if the
    Infringement Claim is wholly or mainly based on:
</p>
<p>
    13.2.1 use or distribution of a Product other than in accordance with this
    Agreement and Snowplow’s published user documentation;
</p>
<p>
    13.2.2 the combination of the relevant Product with products or services
    not provided by Snowplow;
</p>
<p>
    13.2.3 any modification or alteration of a Product by any person other than
    Snowplow;
</p>
<p>
    13.2.4 any Open Source Software; or
</p>
<p>
    13.2.5 the Customer’s failure to apply applicable updates or upgrades, if
    the Infringement Claim would not apply to such update or upgrade.
</p>
<p>
    13.3 If an Infringement Claim is successful or is settled on terms
    requiring it, then Snowplow may at its own expense:
</p>
<p>
    13.3.1 modify the Product so as to avoid the infringement; or
</p>
<p>
    13.3.2 procure for the Customer from the third party right holder the right
    to continue sub-licensing the product,
</p>
<p>
    or, if neither of the above is (in Snowplow's reasonable opinion)
    commercially practicable, terminate the affected Order Form (or modify it
    so as to remove the infringing product from its scope) and refund the
    unused pro-rata portion of any corresponding Charges paid by the Customer,
    and Snowplow will have no further liability to the Customer in respect of
    such Product beyond that described in this clause 13.

<p>
    13.4 Snowplow’s maximum total financial obligation and liability arising
    under or in connection with this clause 13 will in no circumstances exceed
    £5,000,000 (five million pounds sterling).
</p>
<h2>
    14 Force Majeure
</h2>
<p>
    14.1 A “<strong>Force Majeure Event</strong>” is any event or circumstance
    not within a party’s reasonable control, including (in the case of
    Snowplow) failures or outages at upstream or infrastructure suppliers such
    as AWS.
</p>
<p>
    14.2 Provided it has complied with clause 14.3, if a party is prevented,
    hindered or delayed in or from performing any of its obligations under this
    agreement by a Force Majeure Event (the “<strong>Affected Party</strong>”),
    the Affected Party will not be in breach of this Agreement or otherwise
    liable for any such failure or delay in the performance of such
    obligations. The time for performance of such obligations shall be extended
    accordingly, and the corresponding obligations of the other party will be
    suspended, and its time for performance of such obligations extended, to
    the same extent as those of the Affected Party.
</p>
<p>
    14.3 The Affected Party will:
</p>
<p>
    14.3.1 as soon as reasonably practicable after the start of the Force
    Majeure Event, notify the other party of the Force Majeure Event, the date
    on which it started, its likely or potential duration, and the effect of
    the Force Majeure Event on its ability to perform any of its obligations
    under the agreement; and
</p>
<p>
    14.3.2 use all reasonable endeavours to mitigate the effect of the Force
    Majeure Event on the performance of its obligations.
</p>
<p>
    14.4 If the Force Majeure Event prevents, hinders or delays the Affected
    Party's performance of its obligations for more than 30 days, the party not
    affected by the Force Majeure Event may terminate this agreement by written
    notice to the Affected Party.
</p>
<h2>
    15 Term and Termination
</h2>
<p>
    15.1 This Agreement will have effect from the Effective Date until the end
    of the Initial Term, and will thereafter continue until terminated by
either party in accordance with this Agreement (such period, the “    <strong>Further Term</strong>”).
</p>
<p>
    15.2 At any point during the Further Term, either party may terminate
        this Agreement for convenience by 30 days’ written notice to the other.
        If such notice is to expire on a day other than the first working day
        of the month, Snowplow will reduce the final invoice for the recurring
        Charges by a pro rata amount calculated according to the following
        formula:
</p>
<p>
    C x (N ÷ 30)
</p>
<p>
    where:
</p>
<p>
    C is the relevant recurring Charge; and
</p>
<p>
    N is the numeric day in the month on which the termination notice expires.
</p>
<p>
    15.3 Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately if:
</p>
<p>
    15.3.1 the other party fails to pay any amount due under this Agreement on
    the due date for payment and remains in default not less than 30 days after
    being notified to make such payment;
</p>
<p>
    15.3.2 the other party commits a material breach of this Agreement which,
    if capable of being remedied, it has not remedied within 30 days of being
    notified of the breach;
</p>
<p>
    15.3.3 the other party becomes insolvent or unable to pay its debts within
    the meaning of the insolvency legislation applicable to that party;
</p>
<p>
    15.3.4 a person (including the holder of a charge or other security
    interest) is appointed to manage or take control of the whole or part of
    the business or assets of that party, or notice of an intention to appoint
    such a person is given or documents relating to such an appointment are
    filed with any court;
</p>
<p>
    15.3.5 the ability of the other party's creditors to take any action to
    enforce their debts is suspended, restricted or prevented or some or all of
    that party's creditors accept, by agreement or pursuant to a court order,
    an amount of less than the sums owing to them in satisfaction of those
    sums; or
</p>
<p>
    15.3.6 any process is instituted which could lead to the other party being
    dissolved and its assets being distributed to its creditors, shareholders
    or other contributors (other than for the purposes of solvent amalgamation
    or reconstruction).
</p>
<h2>
    16 General
</h2>
<p>
    16.1 This Agreement (and the documents referred to in it) constitutes the
    entire agreement, and supersedes any previous agreement, between the
    parties relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.
</p>
<p>
    16.2 Each party acknowledges that it has not relied on or been induced to
    enter this Agreement by a representation, warranty or undertaking (whether
    contractual or otherwise) other than those expressly set out in this
    Agreement.
</p>
<p>
    16.3 Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, any failure to
    exercise or delay in exercising (whether fully or at all) a right or remedy
    provided by this Agreement or by law does not constitute a waiver of the
    right or remedy or a waiver of any other rights or remedies.
</p>
<p>
    16.4 A notice under or in connection with this Agreement: must be in
    writing; must be in the English language; and must be delivered personally
    or sent by email or first class post to the party due to receive the notice
    at its registered office (in the case of Snowplow) or to the address
    specified in the Order Form (in the case of the Customer).
</p>
<p>
    16.5 A person who is not a party to this Agreement has no right under the
    Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of this
    Agreement.
</p>
<p>
    16.6 Snowplow may subcontract the performance of all or part of this
    Agreement, but as between Snowplow and the Customer, Snowplow will remain
    liable for the acts and omissions of its subcontractors as if they were the
    acts or omissions of Snowplow itself (and subject therefore to the
    limitations and exclusions of liability set out in this Agreement).
</p>
<p>
    16.7 This Agreement and all non-contractual obligations arising out of or
    in connection with it are governed by English law and subject to the
    exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts.

<h5>Notes on the scope of support provided</h5>
<p>Successfully integrating Snowplow trackers in your applications and servers, or third party integrations, has dependencies on those your applications and servers and third party services. Support provided by Snowplow is limited to issues originating in Snowplow technology. Issues originating in your applications and servers or third party services (where the Snowplow tracking is setup) are not covered by the Snowplow support team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, where data collected, processed and by Snowplow Insight is consumed in applications developed by you or applications and services purchased by you from third parties, Snowplow support is limited to issues originating in the Snowplow software or services.</p>
<p>When the Snowplow support team works with you to debug data collection and processing issues, those issues may originate outside of Snowplow software and services. (E.g. they may relate to an incorrectly configured third party tag management solution or a lapsed subscription with a third-party data provider.) Resolving issues originated outside of Snowplow software or services is not in scope for the support provided as part of the Snowplow Insights service.</p>
