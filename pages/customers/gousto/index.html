              <h3>Key results</h3>
                <ul class="styled">
                  <li>With Snowplow, Gousto provides subscribers with a more personalized and convenient shopping experience</li>
                  <li>Improved retention by using Snowplow’s behavioral data to power deep learning models that minimized churn across platforms</li>
                  <li>Optimized return on ad spend across Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Google Ads</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>The challenge</h3>
                <p>Gousto was growing rapidly and doubling in size each year. In order to power their advanced analytics and predictive models as well as optimize marketing spend, the data team needed to gain access to their granular, event-level data. On top of that, Gousto struggled to join web and mobile data with other data sources like email, transactional and customer service history to power their deep learning models.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>The solution</h3>
                <p>With Snowplow data, Gousto gained access to their rich, granular and highly structured event data. Gousto now knows how often and what channels customers visit before subscribing, and can optimize their marketing spend accordingly. With Snowplow, Gousto is able to join rich, granular web and mobile app behavior with their email, Zendesk and transactional data. Gousto uses this data to predict churn so it can offer customers the right interventions at the right time.</p>
