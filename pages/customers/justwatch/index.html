            <p>Barely two years old, JustWatch has expanded into 23 different countries and built profiles of more than 50 million movie fans around the world. It reached profitability in late 2016, less than two years after launching, and counts Sony, Paramount and Fox amongst its clients.</p><br>
            <p>JustWatch was able to do this because they use Snowplow data to develop superior intelligence on movie fans, and that intelligence to deliver superior advertising campaigns for movie studios: campaigns that drive twice the return on ad spend than industry benchmarks.</p>
