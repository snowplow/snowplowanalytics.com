              <h3>Key results</h3>
                <ul class="styled">
                  <li>Picnic enhanced user experience by using Snowplow data to create personalized product recommendations</li>
                  <li>Increased retention by using Snowplow's event-level data to predict when users were likely to churn</li>
                  <li>With Snowplow’s scalable infrastructure, Picnic easily adapted to growing data volumes without service interruptions</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>The challenge</h3>
                <p>Picnic’s customer base was growing by more than 500 percent year-over-year; Picnic needed a data infrastructure that could easily scale and evolve as its business grew. As a mobile-only supermarket, Picnic also wanted to understand each stage of their customers’ journey to deliver a customized and user-friendly experience.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>The solution</h3>
                <p>Snowplow’s modular infrastructure and auto scaling technology allowed Picnic to easily adjust to rapidly growing data volumes. What’s more, using Snowplow’s granular, event-level data, Picnic could quickly A/B test new app features and deliver customized product recommendations to optimize the user experience.</p>
