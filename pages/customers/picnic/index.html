        <h3>Providing a smart, personalised shopping experience</h3>
        <p>Picnic uses Snowplow to track user's experience and engagement with their shopping app. They use the data to drive and validate product development decisions (e.g. using A/B testing) and merchandising decisions. As well as being used for offline analytics, the Snowplow data is used operationally: powering AI algorithms to determine what products to surface in the app.</p>
