            <p>The product team at Simply Business run an ongoing A/B testing program on top of Snowplow data, driving systematic improvements to the on-site experience. In addition, they analyze data to identify and improve friction points in their user journeys.</p><br>
            <p><q><i>Pretty much everyone at Simply Business uses Snowplow, especially the product development team. They use that continuously, to analyse the user journey and question set.(...)We can zoom in where in the form users have an issue and then aggregate the data to understand how many people experience that and how much of a friction point that is. That is powerful.</i></q> - Stewart Duncan.</p>
