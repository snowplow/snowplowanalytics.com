        <p class="text-muted">PEAK is a cognitive training platform with a difference: it collaborates with neuroscientists and psychologists at Yale, Cambridge and other universities to build advanced games to exercise mental skills such as memory, mental agility, problem-solving, language and more. It turns your smartphone into a system for brain measurement, brain tracking and brain training.</p>
