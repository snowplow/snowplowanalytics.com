                <ul class="styled">
                  <li>Peak was able to process dozens of unique data points for millions of users in real-time</li>
                  <li>Flexible, precise and detailed A/B testing implemented to improve user experience</li>
                  <li>Peak gained full data ownership for reliable privacy and security compliance</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>The challenge</h3>
                <p>Peak’s main goal was to grow their user base and business. To do this, Peak needed a way to run frequent A/B tests using customizable events and schemas to optimize user experience. Peak also had to reliably process multiple data points on millions of users in real-time. Finally, because Peak collects personal data on millions of users, it needed to ensure data security and compliance with privacy regulations. Peak realized the only way to do this was to fully own and control all of their data.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>The solution</h3>
                <p>Using Snowplow’s flexible schema’ing technology Peak was able to customize and define events to A/B test new features with precision and detail. Snowplow also helped Peak update their data infrastructure to track user-level and event-level data across multiple sources through a single pipeline and consolidated warehouse. With Snowplow, Peak successfully scaled and started to process unique data points on millions of users in real-time, helping it grow from 1M to 20M users.</p>
