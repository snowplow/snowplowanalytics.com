              <h3>Key results</h3>
                <ul class="styled">
                  <li>GetNinjas grew 8.6x since implementing Snowplow in 2015.</li>
                  <li>2.2x increase in service requests through smarter SEM bidding algorithms on
                	thousands of daily ad campaigns powered by Snowplow data.</li>
                  <li>GetNinjas’ product team created a brilliant user experience across all stages
                	of the user lifecycle.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>The challenge</h3>
                <p>GetNinjas had limited insight into user behavior across their platforms and needed access to their underlying data set in order to understand user journeys and segment users to deliver a superior experience.</p>
                <p>What’s more, GetNinjas was acquiring users for both sides of its marketplace, but didn’t have the data it needed to understand supply and demand by category and city. This meant GetNinjas’ marketing team was working with limited visibility resulting in low ROI and missed growth opportunities.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>The solution</h3>
                <p>With Snowplow, GetNinjas gained full access and control over their rich, granular and well-structured data. This enabled GetNinjas to remove internal data silos and create a single view of users across platforms (web, mobile, SMS) and channels (email, chat, call center).</p>
                <p>As a result, GetNinjas was able to continuously improve their user experience through A/B testing and intelligently optimize SEO and SEM spend to drive user growth.</p>
