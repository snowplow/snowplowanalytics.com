        <h2>GetNinjas had aggressive<br class="visible-lg visible-md"> growth ambitions.</h2>
        <p>They had to deliver an outstanding user experience, both for clients looking for professional service providers, and for the professional service providers themselves. This was essential so that GetNinjas could grow a sustainable community of customers and service providers in each of their cities over time.</p>
        <p>They also had to make sure they intelligently spent on digital marketing to maintain the right balance of clients and professional service providers in each city as they used digital spend to drive the number of users in each city up.</p>
