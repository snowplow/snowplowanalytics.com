              <p class="spacer-bottom-40">Viewbix is a pioneer in interactive video adverts. Their platform makes it easy for brands to build rich, interactive video ad units that offer consumers the chance to engage directly with an ad by signing up for newsletters, completing surveys, locating stores, posting to social networks, downloading coupons and more.</p>

              <h3 style="margin-top: 0px;">Key results</h3>
                <ul class="styled">
                  <li>Viewbix built an analytics platform on top of Snowplow data to provide customers with the insights they need to improve ad performance</li>
                  <li>Viewbix gained complete ownership, visibility and access to their data by hosting Snowplow data in their own AWS data warehouse</li>
                  <li>Viewbix leverages Snowplow’s granular event-level data to design its user-centric product roadmap</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>The challenge</h3>
                <p>Viewbix decided to build their own customer insights platform so Viewbix advertisers could analyze, measure and improve ad campaign performance. To do this, Viewbix needed to track enormous data volumes, and make the data easily available to its customers. Secondly, Viewbix wanted to make data-driven decisions about product feature development and needed access to a richer and more granular data set.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>The solution</h3>
                <p>Viewbix decided to build its Insights platform using Snowplow’s scalable data collection infrastructure. As a result, Viewbix gained access to highly granular data about their customers' campaign performance directly in Redshift, which they made available to their customers through an API. Furthermore, Viewbix started to use Snowplow data internally to drive its product roadmap and prioritize features that enabled advertisers to get better outcomes with Viewbix.</p>
