                        <h4>Multiple platforms</h4>
                        <small>You engage with your users across multiple platforms and channels. So you need to react to your users, coherently, across all those platforms and channels.</small>

                        <h4>Third party APIs</h4>
                        <small>It is common to use multiple third party SaaS providers to manage marketing channels like email, push, display ads etc. Personalizing a user experience across all of them means working with multiple different APIs and protocols, which creates significant technical overhead.</small>

                        <h4>Response speed</h4>
                        <small>The faster you react to an insight e.g. that a user is at risk of churning, the more likely that reaction is to be successful. But reacting in real-time is not technically simple.</small>
